`purrdf-sparql-eval` is the native, RDF 1.2-first **multiset SPARQL evaluator**
of the PurRDF toolkit. It consumes the
[`purrdf-sparql-algebra`](https://crates.io/crates/purrdf-sparql-algebra)
front-end and evaluates over the
[`purrdf-core`](https://crates.io/crates/purrdf-core) IR's `DatasetView`
**entirely in interned `TermId` space** — constants resolve to a dataset id
once, solutions are a single integer compare apart, and computed FILTER/BIND
values that already exist in the dataset are promoted to the interned id at
mint time.

For repeated work, retain an `Arc<PreparedQuery>` from `prepare_query` or
`prepare_algebra` and pass data through substitutions. Compiler-produced algebra
goes directly through structural and registry admission without rendering or parsing
query text. `PreparedQuery::rewritten` also admits and feasibility-orders its input.
The public `query` field remains accessible; execution revalidates caller changes
and refuses any that require replanning.
`query_prepared_governed_in_operation` charges a caller-owned governor across
multiple queries; immutable plans and the governor can be shared by worker-local
engines without locking evaluation globally. Its fallible-view sibling
`query_prepared_governed_fallible_in_operation` preserves operational failure
precedence and publishes only after the final ready checkpoint; a federation
variant accepts a service resolver under the same governor.

The engine's prepared-plan and join-order caches each default to 4096 entries and
64 MiB of charged payload. Configure them independently with
`with_plan_cache_limits` and `with_order_cache_limits`; `PlanCache::with_limits`
serves standalone callers. Retention uses LRU eviction and observable
`CacheStats`. Zero capacity or an oversized plan causes recomputation, never
weaker execution. Byte accounting covers keys, owned algebra, vector capacities,
and shared-string storage charged per occurrence; it excludes allocator overhead
and caller-retained handles. `PlanMemoryObserver` separately reports all live
admitted plan payloads and the portions retained by a cache or held exclusively
by callers, even after cache replacement or destruction. Each allocation is counted
once regardless of `Arc` clones. Its admission estimates do not track later
public-field mutations; `PreparedQuery::retained_size_bytes` computes the current
payload. Public totals saturate without losing internal lifetime accounting.
Neither counter is an RSS measurement. Dataset statistics key
join-order hints only, never result reuse. The existing caller-owned
`eval::BgpOrderCache` alias remains available with its original type.

`make bench-prepared-reuse` measures cold/warm preparation and prepared execution
using the release profile (O3/full LTO). The `prepared_admission` benchmark isolates
structural revalidation and minimal repeated execution; the
`prepared_reuse_counters` example separately records allocator requests, cache
activity, plan lifetimes and governor work. Measurements are report-only and use
synthetic data. Allocator-requested bytes and governor intermediate cells are
different denominations, recorded separately.

`construct_prepared_into_view` appends a complete typed CONSTRUCT graph to an
existing `RdfDatasetBuilder`, using the ordinary template and projection-loss
machinery. It stages and validates terms without freezing or serializing an
intermediate dataset. Repeated appends mint destination-disjoint blank nodes
while preserving blank identities carried by input bindings. The operation and
fallible-view variants publish nothing after an error, cancellation or exhausted
governor. `GraphBuildStats` records staged statements and payload, actual copied
payload, intermediate freezes and supplied governor evidence independently of
the graph's identity.

Design pillars:

- **Multiset (bag) semantics** — solutions are a bag, preserved until
  `DISTINCT`/`REDUCED`.
- **Property paths in-engine** — the full path algebra (`* + ? / | ^ !()`)
  evaluated over the same indexed surface, wasm-safe.
- **Query features** — aggregates, `EXISTS`/`NOT EXISTS` answered by a
  memoized existence probe where a prepare-time proof licenses it and by the
  per-row definition otherwise, cost-based BGP planning (with an
  `explain_query` introspection API), SPARQL UPDATE, the SEP-0009 composite
  datatypes (`FOLD`/`UNFOLD` and the `cdt:` function library), and a
  host-injectable `SERVICE` resolver so federation stays wasm-portable (no
  HTTP client ships; the host supplies the `HttpTransport` and the resolver).
- **Caller-keyed extension seams** — scalar functions (`UserFunctionRegistry`,
  whose native bodies carry SPARQL's expression-error channel so a per-solution
  domain error drops the row under `FILTER` or leaves the variable unbound
  under `BIND` rather than aborting the query), property functions
  (`PropertyFunctionRegistry`, with the path-witness relations and the
  embedding-kNN relation over a PURREMB space shipped in-crate), custom
  aggregates (`AggregateRegistry`, plus a namespace-keyed statistical set), and
  per-service `SERVICE` context (`ServiceCatalog`/`ServiceProfile`: headers,
  credentials, timeouts, capabilities, deny by default). Every seam is keyed by
  IRIs the caller supplies; the crate mints none.
- **Governed execution** — every entry point has a governed twin under
  caller-set ceilings (fuel, answer rows, intermediate cells, scratch bytes,
  remote requests, deadline) that trips with certified rows, never a wrong
  answer.
- **Hard-fail** — an out-of-scope algebra node or unimplemented builtin is a
  typed `EvalError::Unsupported`, never a partial or wrong answer.

The engine is gated by the W3C SPARQL 1.1 and 1.2 conformance suites (run
through the workspace harness), carries zero oxigraph-family dependencies, and
builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

## Usage

```sh
cargo add purrdf-sparql-eval
```

```rust
use purrdf_core::{RdfDatasetBuilder, RdfLiteral, SparqlEngine, SparqlRequest, SparqlResult};
use purrdf_sparql_eval::NativeSparqlEngine;

// A tiny dataset in interned TermId space.
let mut b = RdfDatasetBuilder::new();
let cat = b.intern_iri("https://example.org/cat");
let says = b.intern_iri("https://example.org/says");
let meow = b.intern_literal(RdfLiteral::simple("meow"));
b.push_quad(cat, says, meow, None);
let ds = b.freeze().expect("freeze");

// Evaluate through the SparqlEngine seam; parsed plans are memoized.
let engine = NativeSparqlEngine::new();
let result = engine.query(&ds, SparqlRequest {
    query: "SELECT ?what WHERE { <https://example.org/cat> <https://example.org/says> ?what }",
    base_iri: None,
    substitutions: &[],
}).expect("evaluates");

if let SparqlResult::Solutions { rows, .. } = result {
    assert_eq!(rows.len(), 1);
}
```

Serialize results to SPARQL JSON/XML/CSV/TSV with the sibling
[`purrdf-sparql-results`](https://crates.io/crates/purrdf-sparql-results) crate.

## Part of PurRDF

This crate is one member of the [PurRDF](https://github.com/Blackcat-Informatics/purrdf)
workspace — an RDF 1.2 toolkit with native codecs, SPARQL, SHACL, ShEx,
entailment, and the GTS graph transport, carried into Python, WebAssembly, and
C (the GTS container itself reaches Python and C, not the wasm package). Most applications should depend on the umbrella
[`purrdf`](https://crates.io/crates/purrdf) crate, which re-exports this crate
under `purrdf::sparql`; depend on `purrdf-sparql-eval` directly only when you
want the evaluator alone.

There are deliberately no Cargo feature flags anywhere in the workspace. MSRV
follows the workspace `rust-version` (currently 1.96, stable toolchain only).
