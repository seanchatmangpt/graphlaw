//! Dynamic, host-injected user functions — of two kinds under one IRI namespace.
//!
//! A call-position IRI that is under no configured extension-function namespace
//! (so not the closed, parse-time-resolved `PurrdfFn` set) is lowered by the
//! parser to [`Function::Custom`](purrdf_sparql_algebra::Function::Custom) and
//! resolved at eval time against a caller-injected [`UserFunctionRegistry`] — the
//! open counterpart to `PurrdfFn` dispatch. The registry holds two independent
//! kinds keyed by IRI, hard-failing on a cross-kind collision so an IRI is
//! unambiguously one kind or the other:
//!
//! - **SHACL-AF SPARQL-bodied** ([`UserFunction`]) — declared by a shapes graph as
//!   an IRI typed `sh:SPARQLFunction` with ordered `sh:parameter`s, an optional
//!   `sh:returnType`, and a `sh:select`/`sh:ask` body. This kind is pure data
//!   (parsed body + parameter metadata); executing a call binds the arguments to
//!   the parameter variables as a pre-binding rewrite (the same `crate::substitute`
//!   path `$this` injection uses) and evaluates the body in a recursion-bounded
//!   child context, keeping SPARQL execution inside the evaluator and the registry
//!   free of engine coupling.
//!
//! - **Native (host-Rust closure)** ([`NativeFunction`], registered via
//!   [`UserFunctionRegistry::register_native`]) — a `Send + Sync` closure over the
//!   already-evaluated argument values (see [`NativeFnBody`]) for scoring
//!   predicates whose bodies cannot be expressed in SPARQL (e.g. an external-index
//!   read). It carries a declared [`Arity`] (fail-fast checked before the closure
//!   runs) and a [`Volatility`] the fork-join parallel-evaluation gate consults to
//!   decide whether the call may run across worker threads. It takes no
//!   [`EvalCtx`] and so cannot re-enter the evaluator.
//!
//! - **Dataset-aware (expression-bodied)** ([`ExprFunction`], registered via
//!   [`UserFunctionRegistry::register_expr`]) — a `Send + Sync` closure that, unlike
//!   the native kind, is handed the GRAPH the calling query is running over plus the
//!   current call depth, through [`ExprFnCall`]. It exists for the SHACL 1.2 SPARQL
//!   Extensions §7 "Declaring SPARQL Functions based on Node Expressions" seam, where
//!   the body is a node expression evaluated against a focus graph rather than a
//!   SPARQL query. See [`ExprFnCall::focus_graph`] for why the graph is a concrete
//!   [`Arc<RdfDataset>`] rather than the context's own `D: DatasetView` (which is not
//!   object-safe — it carries an associated `Id` type), and `eval_expr_function` for
//!   the re-entrancy bound.
//!
//! # One error channel across all three kinds
//!
//! Every kind reports "this call has no value for this solution" the same way:
//! `Ok(None)`, the SPARQL expression error of §17.2. `Err` is reserved for a hard
//! failure that aborts the whole query. That uniformity is load-bearing rather than
//! tidy — a seam without the `Ok(None)` exit forces a per-solution domain refusal
//! (a malformed literal, an out-of-range index, a type mismatch) onto `Err`, which
//! aborts a query the specification says should merely drop a row or leave a
//! variable unbound. See [`NativeFnBody`] for the specification text and for why
//! the enclosing operator, not the body, decides which of those two outcomes a
//! given `Ok(None)` produces.

/// * `Ok(None)` — a SPARQL **expression error**: the arguments are the wrong type,

///   scoped to the one solution being evaluated. SPARQL 1.1 §17.2 puts extension
///   functions squarely in this channel — "Functions invoked with an argument of
///   the wrong type will produce a type error" — and the enclosing operator then
///   decides the outcome: a `FILTER` **drops that solution** (§17 "FILTERs
///   eliminate any solutions that, when substituted into the expression, either
///   result in an effective boolean value of false or produce an error"), while a
///   `BIND`/`SELECT`-expression **leaves the variable unbound** (§10 "If the

///   for that solution but the query evaluation continues"; algebra §18.5
///   `Extend(μ, var, expr) = μ if var not in dom(μ) and expr(μ) is an error`).
///   Those are two different outcomes from one signal, and the evaluator — not the
///   host closure — is what knows which context the call sits in.
/// * `Err(_)` — a **hard failure that aborts the whole query**, for a condition no
///   per-solution outcome can honestly express: the host's wiring is unusable, or
///   the function is registered but not implemented. `Ok(None)` there would be a
///   silent wrong answer, because a dropped row and an unbound variable are
///   indistinguishable from an honest empty result.
///
/// This is the same channel [`ExprFnBody`] carries, deliberately spelled the same
/// way: the two seams differ in what the evaluator *hands* a body (see
/// [`ExprFnCall`]), never in how a body reports that it has no value. A seam with
/// no `Ok(None)` exit forces every domain refusal onto `Err`, which turns one bad
/// literal in one row into a failed query — so there is no lossy variant of this

/// the call, so the dispatch path lends the closure those borrows rather than deep
/// cloning each [`TermValue`] (which owns heap strings for IRIs/literals) on the
/// per-row scoring hot path this seam exists to serve. A closure that needs to
/// retain a value past the call clones it itself.
///
/// Unlike a [`UserFunction`]'s SPARQL body, this takes **no [`EvalCtx`]** — it
/// therefore cannot re-enter the evaluator, so there is no recursion/re-entrancy
/// boundary to bound (the SPARQL-bodied path's `MAX_UDF_DEPTH` guard does not
/// apply here). When a function is declared non-[`Volatile`](Volatility::Volatile)
