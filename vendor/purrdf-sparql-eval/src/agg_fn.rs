//! Host-injected **custom aggregates** — the fold algebra `AGG(<iri>, args…)`
//! dispatches against.
//!
//! `AggregateFunction::Custom(iri)`
//! ([`purrdf_sparql_algebra::AggregateFunction::Custom`]) names a `GROUP BY`
//! reduction the closed SPARQL 1.1 built-in set (`COUNT`/`SUM`/`AVG`/`MIN`/`MAX`/
//! `SAMPLE`/`GROUP_CONCAT`) does not cover, resolved at evaluation time against a
//! caller-injected [`AggregateRegistry`]. Where [`crate::property_fn`] injects a
//! *relation* (a row source in graph-pattern position) and [`crate::user_fn`]
//! injects a *scalar function* (one value per call, in expression position), this
//! module injects a **fold**: a `GROUP BY` group's rows reduce to one value through
//! a caller-supplied accumulator, exactly as a built-in aggregate does.
//!
//! # The fold shape, shared with the built-ins — literally, not just in prose
//!
//! Every aggregate — built-in or custom — is `init` (an aggregate's answer over the
//! empty group, `finish(init())`, is never absent: `COUNT` → `0`, `SUM` → `0`,
//! `AVG`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`SAMPLE` → unbound, `GROUP_CONCAT` → `""`), `step` (fold one
//! row's already-evaluated argument tuple in), and `finish` (produce the group's
//! answer, or `None` for unbound) — exactly [`AggregateAccumulator`]'s three
//! methods. Every built-in aggregate (`crate::modifier`'s `CountAccumulator`/
//! `SumAccumulator`/`AvgAccumulator`/`MinAccumulator`/`MaxAccumulator`/
//! `SampleAccumulator`/`GroupConcatAccumulator`) is a genuine
//! `impl AggregateAccumulator`, the SAME trait a [`CustomAggregate::init`] call
//! produces from a HOST registration — one fold algebra, not two. Only the
//! DISPATCH differs: a built-in's concrete accumulator type is known at compile
//! time, so `crate::modifier::fold_builtin` drives it by generic monomorphization
//! (an ordinary, inlinable call on every `step`, no vtable); a registered
//! aggregate's concrete type is not known until [`AggregateRegistry::resolve`]
//! looks up an IRI at RUN time, so it is necessarily driven through
//! `Box<dyn AggregateAccumulator>` — the one place this module's own dynamic
//! dispatch earns its cost. See `crate::modifier::eval_aggregate`'s doc comment
//! for the one dispatch SITE both paths share, and `crate::modifier::fold_builtin`'s
//! for why the static path never pays a per-row cost for implementing the
//! identical trait a dynamically dispatched aggregate uses.
//!
//! # The trust boundary
//!
//! A registered aggregate is arbitrary host Rust. As with [`crate::property_fn`],
//! every invariant the evaluator needs from it is either checked before host code
//! runs (arity, at prepare time — see `crate::property_fn_plan::plan_query`'s
//! walk), contained when host code panics (every one of `init`/`step`/`combine`/
//! `finish` and every declaration read, via the `crate::contain` helpers this
//! module shares with [`crate::property_fn`]), or applied to what host code
//! returns. A host aggregate that misbehaves cannot make the engine unsound; it can
//! only make its own call fail.
//!
//! # `combine` and determinism
//!
//! [`AggregateAccumulator::combine`] merges one accumulator's state into another's,
//! **in the chunk order the caller presents them** — never reordered, never run
//! concurrently on the same accumulator. That is what lets a non-commutative,
//! order-sensitive custom aggregate (a running median with a tie-break rule, a
//! last-write-wins accumulator) stay deterministic even when its group's rows were
//! folded by more than one worker: the merge order is fixed by source order, not by
//! which worker finished first. [`CustomAggregate::algebraic_class`] documents which
//! algebraic law a given aggregate satisfies, for a caller that wants to reason
//! about it; the evaluator itself does not need the classification to fold correctly,
//! since `combine`'s fixed chunk-order contract already makes the fixed-order reduce
//! safe for every class. `crate::modifier::eval_custom_aggregate` is the caller that
//! actually drives this: for a large enough group whose aggregate declares
//! [`Volatility::Stable`], it folds the group's rows in chunks (one accumulator per
//! chunk, via `crate::parallel::par_chunk_reduce_init`) and reduces the partial
//! accumulators through `combine`, strictly in chunk-index order — a `Volatile`
//! aggregate stays on the single-accumulator sequential fold this module always
//! supported, exactly as `crate::eval::EvalCtx::may_fork_aggregate`'s per-GROUP fork
//! gate excludes it there too.
//!
//! # Merging structural state through `into_any`
//!
//! `combine` receives `other` as a fully type-erased `Box<dyn
//! AggregateAccumulator>` — reachable, naively, through only the trait's own
//! object-safe surface. For an aggregate whose finished, single-term answer IS
//! sufficient mergeable state (`SUM`'s running total, `GROUP_CONCAT`'s joined
//! string), `other.finish()` is all `combine` ever needs — the shape this
//! module's own `SumAccumulator` test fixture and `crate::modifier`'s
//! `ListCollector` use. For an aggregate whose finished answer throws away
//! information a correct merge needs — a running median's whole value list, a
//! running mode's per-value counts, a running variance's `(n, Σx, Σx²)` — the
//! finish-only path is not merely inconvenient, it is WRONG, because it would
//! fold the finished, already-reduced answer back in as if it were one more
//! row rather than merging the aggregate's actual state.
//! [`AggregateAccumulator::into_any`] is the escape hatch for exactly this
//! case: it recovers `other`'s original concrete type, so `combine` can merge
//! the SAME structural state `step` builds. The downcast is same-type BY
//! CONSTRUCTION — every partial accumulator a single `combine` chain ever
//! merges was created by the SAME [`CustomAggregate::init`] factory
//! (`crate::parallel::par_chunk_reduce_init` never mixes accumulators from two
//! different registrations) — so a mismatch can only mean a host bug, never a
//! state this crate's own evaluator can produce. Consume the recovered type with
//! `other.into_any().downcast::<Self>()`, mapping the `Err(Box<dyn Any + Send>)`
//! case (the impossible-by-construction mismatch above) to an [`EvalError`] and
//! propagating it with `?` — that is the ordinary, public way to consume
//! [`into_any`](AggregateAccumulator::into_any)'s result from OUTSIDE this crate,
//! and it is what returns `Err(EvalError::Function)` on a mismatch rather than
//! panicking — `combine`'s own `Result` return type (not `()`) is what makes that
//! a plain propagated error instead of a panic `combine_contained`'s
//! `crate::contain` containment would otherwise have to catch, which matters
//! because that containment cannot run at all under `panic = "abort"` (see the
//! wasm32 note below). This crate's OWN accumulators (`crate::stat_agg`'s
//! `MEDIAN`/`PERCENTILE`/`STDDEV`-family/`MODE`/`TOPK` members) happen to share a
//! private `downcast_combine_partial` helper for identical error text across all
//! five, but that helper is `pub(crate)` and not part of this crate's public API
//! — an external implementation reaches for the plain `downcast::<Self>()` call
//! above instead, exactly as shown in the book's custom-aggregate walkthrough.
//!
//! # wasm32 note
//!
//! `combine_contained` still wraps every `combine` call in `crate::contain`'s
//! `catch_unwind`-based containment, for an implementation that panics for a
//! reason of its own outside the downcast — that containment still requires
//! `panic = "unwind"` and is unavailable under `panic = "abort"` exactly as every
//! other extension seam's is (see `crate::contain`'s module docs). The
//! same-type-by-construction downcast above no longer depends on it: reported
//! through a typed `Err`, not a panic, it degrades cleanly on every target
//! regardless of panic strategy.
