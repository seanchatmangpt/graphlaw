//! Deterministic two-phase parallel evaluation primitives.
//!
//! [`crate::bgp`]'s per-batch evaluation, `binop`'s `Join`/`LeftJoin`/`MINUS`/
//! `Union`, `expr::eval_filter`/`eval_extend`, `binop::left_outer_join_filtered`,
//! and `modifier::eval_group`'s per-group aggregates are all wired to the
//! fork-join model below. The two phases, always in this order:
//!
//! 1. **Fork.** [`crate::eval::EvalCtx::fork_for_worker`] gives each worker a
//!    `Send` child context with its own scratch/constructed state, so workers
//!    never contend on a lock or share mutable evaluation state.
//! 2. **Join.** [`par_chunk_try_map_init`]/[`par_chunk_map`]/[`par_retain`] run
//!    the workers via rayon's *indexed* `par_chunks`/`par_iter` (never
//!    `par_sort`/`par_bridge`, which are not order-stable) and then reduce
//!    strictly in source-index order: successes concatenate in chunk (hence
//!    source) order and the first `Err` **by chunk index** wins, regardless of
//!    which worker finished first.
//!
//! A read-only FILTER predicate discards its child's scratch mints entirely (the
//! surviving rows are the original rows, nothing new escapes). A **minting** node
//! — `UNION`, per-group aggregates, `BIND`/`Extend` — is different: its output
//! rows can carry a cell the child *just interned*, and the child (and its
//! scratch) is dropped the moment the fork-join call returns, so that cell's
//! `ScratchId` cannot be resolved against the child after the fact. Those callers
//! instead materialize each escaping row to a dataset-independent
//! ([`PortableTerm`]) form **while the child is still alive** ([`portable_row`])
//! and the node re-interns it against the **parent** scratch afterwards, strictly
//! in source-index order ([`reintern_portable_row`]) — see those two functions'
//! doc comments for the base-aware id rule that makes this exact, not just
//! value-equal, to the sequential path.
//!
//! Note there is no `constructed`-merging counterpart here: the parallel minting
//! path only ever runs when [`is_parallel_safe`]/[`is_parallel_safe_pattern`]
//! passes, which excludes every builtin that pushes to
//! [`crate::eval::EvalCtx::constructed`] (the blank-minting list constructors) —
//! so a forked child on this path never populates `constructed`, and there is
//! nothing to fold back.
//!
//! [`is_parallel_safe`] is the gate deciding whether an expression may run under
//! this model at all: any builtin whose result depends on the per-query mutable
//! `bnode_counter`/`rng_state` (or that mints into [`crate::eval::EvalCtx::constructed`])
//! is excluded, because the fork model gives every worker an *independent* copy of
//! that state rather than a shared, ordered one — running such a builtin under
//! fork-join would make its result depend on worker scheduling, not just row
//! content. [`Function::Custom`] — a caller-injected user function resolved
//! against a [`UserFunctionRegistry`] — is likewise excluded unless the registry
//! attests the callee is safe: a native function is safe only when registered
//! [`Volatility::Stable`], and a SPARQL-bodied function is conservatively always
//! unsafe (its body can itself reach `RAND`/`UUID`/`BNODE`/the list constructors,
//! and that per-call state would merge into a forked child instead of `ctx`).

/// - a bounded-arithmetic fold (`SUM`/`AVG`, or any other accumulator whose `combine` is
///   not exactly reassociation-proof) sees a different sequence of intermediate values
///   depending on exactly where the chunk boundaries fall.
///
/// A chunk count that tracked `rayon::current_num_threads()` therefore made both the
/// governor's CHARGE and, for some accumulators, the query's ANSWER depend on the machine
/// the query happened to run on — the same (query, data, ceiling) triple could be admitted
/// on a small box and refused on a big one. That is a portability break `.goals`' MAXIMAL

///
/// Real parallelism is unaffected: [`par_chunk_reduce_init`] still hands the resulting
