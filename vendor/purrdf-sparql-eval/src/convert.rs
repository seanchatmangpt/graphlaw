//! Conversions from the lexical [`purrdf_sparql_algebra`] term types to the
//! dataset-independent [`TermValue`] lookup/build key.
//!
//! The algebra carries terms lexically (an IRI string, a literal's lexical form +
//! datatype IRI); the IR keys term identity on [`TermValue`]. These helpers bridge
//! the two and apply the one normalization the IR's C0.1 literal-identity contract
//! requires at the lookup boundary: a language tag is lowercased so a query literal
//! matches the dataset's interned (already-lowercased) form.

/// it queries — so `BIND("[_:b, 42]"^^cdt:List AS ?l)` names a node distinct from

/// Turtle files that both write `_:b` name two nodes. Without a scope of its own
/// the query-authored label lands at [`BlankScope::DEFAULT`] — which is precisely
/// where a directly-parsed document's blanks live — and the two collapse onto one
/// node.
///
/// Two occurrences of one label in the SAME query still denote the SAME node:
/// they share this one scope, so they intern to a single value. That is the

/// sources of a merge, counting up. The query therefore takes the far end, and
/// `BlankScope(u32::MAX)` is **reserved**: no dataset may intern a blank node
/// under it. [`ScratchInterner::intern`](crate::scratch::ScratchInterner::intern)
/// enforces the query half of that reservation directly — a value at this scope is
/// never promoted to a dataset term — so the separation does not rest on the
/// dataset merely happening not to hold the label.

/// carries (a constant expression, a `CONSTRUCT`/`INSERT` template cell, a

/// does for a literal read from a document.
