//! The distance kernels the embedding kNN surface ranks by, and the total order it
//! ranks in.
//!
//! # Why binary64, when the workspace's other ranked-retrieval surface uses no floats
//!
//! Ranking is only reproducible if the numbers it compares are, and a scoring kernel is
//! the classic place for that to fail: two builds of one engine disagree by a unit in the
//! last place, two nearly-tied candidates swap, and the same query over the same data
//! returns rows in a different order depending on where it was compiled. That is an
//! answer divergence, not a rounding detail.
//!
//! The usual remedy is to leave floating point behind entirely. That is the right remedy
//! when the kernel needs a **transcendental** — a `ln`, an `exp`, a `pow` — because those
//! are the operations IEEE-754 does *not* require to be correctly rounded, so every libm
//! is entitled to a different answer and they take it. A kNN kernel needs none of them.
//! Squared Euclidean distance is subtraction, multiplication and addition; cosine
//! distance adds a division and a square root. **All five are correctly rounded by
//! IEEE-754**, which means each one has exactly one permissible result for a given pair
//! of inputs on every conforming target — `wasm32-unknown-unknown` included.
//!
//! So there are only two ways a float kernel can still diverge, and this module closes
//! both:
//!
//! * **Reassociation.** Floating-point addition is not associative, so a sum's value
//!   depends on the order it was accumulated in. Every fold here runs over ascending
//!   component index, in one sequential loop, and no accumulation is ever split across
//!   rayon workers or chunked. The order is part of the contract, not an implementation
//!   detail: [`accumulation_order_is_pinned`](tests::accumulation_order_is_pinned)
//!   exercises a vector whose sum genuinely differs when folded the other way.
//! * **Fused multiply-add.** `a * b + c` computed as a single FMA rounds once where the
//!   written form rounds twice, and the two differ. Rust never contracts them
//!   implicitly, and PURREMB v1 forbids the fusion normatively ("performed in the written
//!   order without a fused multiply-add"). Every product below is therefore bound to a
//!   named local before it is added — the same shape, for the same reason, that
//!   `purrdf_core`'s own deterministic L2 fold uses.
//!
//! This is not a weaker guarantee than the integer route; for these five operations it is
//! the same guarantee, and it is the one the artifact format itself already specifies.
//! Its limit is stated where it belongs: on [`Kernel::distance`], which reports whether
//! its result stayed finite rather than ranking by an infinity.
//!
//! # The metric definitions are PURREMB's, not this module's
//!
//! PURREMB v1 defines the three built-in metrics as `1 - dot(x, y) / (L2(x) · L2(y))`,
//! `-dot(x, y)` and `sum((x[i] - y[i])²)`, **smaller ranks first**, with cosine undefined
//! for a zero-norm operand. This module implements exactly those, in exactly that sense,
//! and does not invent a fourth.
