//! Solution-term identity: the [`SolutionTerm`] bound-value representation and the
//! per-query [`ScratchInterner`] for computed terms.
//!
//! ## The unification rule (the heart of the evaluator's hot path)
//!
//! A variable binding is either a term that exists in the queried dataset
//! ([`SolutionTerm::Existing`], a dataset-local [`TermId`]) or a term *minted*
//! during evaluation ([`SolutionTerm::Computed`], a [`ScratchId`] into the
//! per-query scratch table) — e.g. the result of `CONCAT`, arithmetic, or a
//! `VALUES`/template constant absent from the data.
//!
//! [`ScratchInterner::intern`] **first probes the dataset**
//! (`term_id_by_value`, P4): if the value already exists, the binding is
//! promoted to [`SolutionTerm::Existing`] and never becomes `Computed`. The
//! consequence is load-bearing:
//!
//! - `Existing == Existing` is a raw [`TermId`] integer compare (the BGP/join hot
//!   path — zero string resolution).
//! - `Existing` vs `Computed` is **always unequal by construction**, because any
//!   value present in the dataset would have been promoted at mint time. No
//!   structural fallback is ever needed at join time.
//! - `Computed == Computed` is a [`ScratchId`] compare (the scratch interns by
//!   value, so equal values share an id).
//!
//! So [`SolutionTerm`] stays `Copy + Eq + Hash` and every join-key comparison is a
//! single integer compare. The one lookup cost (`term_id_by_value`) is paid only
//! when a term is *minted* (BIND/VALUES/aggregate output), never in BGP matching.
