//! The governed row-ingest core: the one admission sequence every operator that
//! ingests rows **from outside the dataset** runs before each row it keeps.
//!
//! Two operators produce rows the dataset's own indexes never sized: `SERVICE`
//! (whatever a remote endpoint chose to send) and a property-function call (whatever
//! a host relation chose to emit). Both are therefore the only bags in the evaluator
//! whose size an outside party picks, and both need exactly the same three things to
//! happen, in exactly this order, for every row:
//!
//! 1. **Observe the cell ceiling BEFORE interning.** The ceiling is an admission
//!    boundary: the first over-limit row must be refused *before* its storage is
//!    constructed and before its values enter the scratch arena, or the ceiling has
//!    already been exceeded by the time it is consulted.
//! 2. **Charge the per-row point, if the caller minted one.** Charging in row order
//!    is what makes the ingested prefix a **positional prefix** of the producer's
//!    answer, which is what lets the truncation certificate describe it.
//! 3. **Intern, then store.** Only a row that survived both gates is materialized.
//!
//! Writing that sequence once is not tidiness. The two call sites disagreeing about
//! the order — charging before observing, or interning before either — would make the
//! governor that trips depend on which operator produced the row, and a frozen
//! governor vector is precisely a record of which governor tripped when.
//!
//! # What this core deliberately does NOT do
//!
//! It does not pull rows. `SERVICE` ingests an already-materialized response; a
//! property-function call pulls from a live cursor and must poll its stop signal
//! between pulls (the deaf-relation doctrine on [`crate::property_fn::PfCursor`]).
//! Folding the pull into the core would force one of those two shapes onto the other.
//! The core is the **admission** step; the producers keep their own loops.
