//! SPARQL property-path evaluation (S8) — the wasm-safe in-engine runtime.
//!
//! A property path constrains two endpoints by a *relation* between them rather
//! than a single triple. This module evaluates the `Path` graph pattern entirely in
//! interned [`TermId`](purrdf_core::TermId) space over the same indexed
//! [`DatasetView::quads_for_pattern`] surface the BGP hot path uses, returning a
//! [`SolutionSeq`] over the path's variable endpoint(s) that composes through the
//! existing join machinery unchanged.
//!
//! ## The reachability primitive
//!
//! Evaluation follows the SPARQL 1.1 §18.1.7 ALP (arbitrary-length-path) shape: a
//! single direction-parameterised primitive [`reach`], where
//! `reach(path, node, forward)` returns the set of nodes `y` such that
//! `(node, y)` is in the path relation (forward), or `(y, node)` is (backward).
//! Every operator is structural recursion over the path expression:
//!
//! - `^p` (`Reverse`) flips the direction flag.
//! - `p/q` (`Sequence`) chains: `reach(q, ·)` over each `reach(p, node)` (and the
//!   order swaps under backward evaluation so predecessors compose correctly).
//! - `p|q` (`Alternative`) unions both sub-relations.
//! - `p?` (`ZeroOrOne`) adds the zero-length identity `{node}`.
//! - `p*`/`p+` (`ZeroOrMore`/`OneOrMore`) take the transitive closure with a
//!   **visited-set guard on the endpoint frontier**, so cyclic graphs terminate.
//! - `p{n,m}` (`Range`, a PurRDF extension) is **k-fold composition unioned over
//!   `[n, m]`**, re-entrant per `k` (NOT one global visited set across `k`) so a
//!   node reachable at several repetition counts is reported for each — a single
//!   visited-guarded level-BFS would be *wrong* on cyclic graphs.
//! - `!(…)` (`NegatedPropertySet`) and `<any>`/`<any:ns>` (`Wildcard`, a PurRDF
//!   extension) scan any-predicate edges, filtering by the excluded set or the
//!   namespace prefix respectively.
//!
//! Determinism: every intermediate is a `BTreeSet<TermId>`, so the materialised
//! solution order is the dataset's `TermId` order over the frozen dataset — the
//! same canonical discipline the rest of the evaluator follows.
