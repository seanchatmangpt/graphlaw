//! The partial-lift channel: the third result an operator can produce, beside a complete
//! bag and a genuine failure.
//!
//! # Why a third channel exists at all
//!
//! Evaluation is fully materialized and every operator returns
//! `Result<SolutionSeq, EvalError>`. With only those two channels a governor trip deep in
//! the plan has exactly one way out — the error channel — and an error carries no rows,
//! so "the partial answers found so far" would be unimplementable for every governor
//! except a cap tested at the very end. [`Evaluated`] is that third channel:
//! [`Evaluated::Complete`] is the ordinary result, and [`Evaluated::Truncated`] carries
//! the rows the evaluator actually holds **together with a machine-checked statement of
//! what they bound**.
//!
//! # What a truncated bag is allowed to claim
//!
//! Never "these are the answers". A [`Truncation`] claims exactly one of three things,
//! and the claim is composed, not asserted:
//!
//! - [`SpineClass::Certain`] — a **lower** bound: every row here is an answer. Safe to
//!   admit.
//! - [`SpineClass::Possible`] — an **upper** bound: every answer is here, but some rows
//!   here may not be answers. Safe only for "definitely not an answer".
//! - [`SpineClass::Unknown`] — **neither**. No row crosses; a [`NonMonotoneBarrier`]
//!   crosses in their place, naming the operator that withheld them.
//!
//! The composition is the classical interval algebra over the two axes
//! [`crate::governor::soundness`] computes — which side of the interval an edge
//! contributes to ([`ChildRole`]) and whether the positional prefix relation survives it
//! ([`crate::governor::soundness::PrefixFidelity`]). A parent never invents a bound: it
//! pushes the edge it descended onto the truncation's path and the class is **recomputed
//! from that path by the same [`SpineContext::descend`] the plan-level analysis uses**.
//! One composition function, so the evaluator's certificate and the plan-level
//! certificate cannot disagree — an equality that would otherwise be a coincidence two
//! implementations have to keep agreeing on.
//!
//! # Commit granularity
//!
//! A row is *committed* only when the producing operator has finished **all** output for
//! the input row that generated it. A trip discards the in-flight operator instance's
//! uncommitted output entirely.
//!
//! This is the single most dangerous rule in the whole channel, and `OPTIONAL` is where
//! it bites. `LeftJoin` emits a left row padded with unbound **iff no compatible right
//! row exists**; that is a statement about the *whole* right bag. Emitting a padded left
//! row while holding only part of the right bag would state something the evaluator has
//! not established — a fabricated answer, which is categorically worse than a missing
//! one. So an operator whose per-input-row output depends on completing a scan
//! (`LeftJoin`, `Minus`, `Group`, `EXISTS`/`NOT EXISTS`, `Distinct`) commits per **input**
//! row, never per emitted row, and when it cannot complete the scan it emits nothing for
//! that input row at all.
//!
//! It bites in **both** directions at `LeftJoin`, which is the part that was originally
//! got wrong. A truncated *left* arm must not pad, for the reason above. A truncated
//! *right* arm must not pad either — the right bag is a prefix, so "no compatible right
//! row exists" is not a fact the operator holds about any left row — and the padded row
//! is not merely imprecise there, it is emitted **instead of** the true pairings the cut
//! hid, so it is neither a lower bound nor an upper one. With the padding suppressed the
//! operator computes an inner join over the prefix, whose every row is an answer; that is
//! why `LeftJoin`'s right edge is [`ChildEdge::MONOTONE_BAG`] and not
//! [`ChildEdge::ANTITONE`]. `Minus` keeps the antitone edge, because subtracting less
//! really does leave a superset.
//!
//! # One observable rule per operator, whichever path evaluated it
//!
//! A governor may not report a different partial result because a different scheduler
//! ran. Only `UNION` starts two sibling patterns at once (`rayon::join`), and under
//! engaged governors it no longer does: both branches are whole patterns, so both charge
//! the one shared `GovernorState`, and forking them let the two arms race the same
//! counter. That was not a theoretical hazard — `{ ?s ex:p ?o } UNION { ?s ex:q ?o }`
//! under nine fuel produced seven distinct outcomes across sixty runs of one process,
//! differing in both the certified rows and the reported consumption. A governed `UNION`
//! therefore evaluates its arms in source order on one thread
//! ([`EvalCtx::may_fork_sibling_patterns`](crate::eval::EvalCtx::may_fork_sibling_patterns)),
//! and `binop::union_branch_order` keeps the discard rule that the ungoverned fork still
//! needs — a computed right branch is dropped when the left one truncated, so the two
//! paths agree on rows as well as on budget. Audited and found not to have the shape at
//! all: `Join`, `Minus`, `LeftJoin`, and `Lateral` evaluate their arms one after the
//! other on one thread, so a truncated left arm stops the operator before the right arm
//! begins on either path; the chunked row loops in `FILTER`/`BIND`/`OPTIONAL`-with-filter
//! and the per-group aggregate fork parallelize *within* one operator over an input that
//! is already materialized, and a truncation reached from inside one of their expressions
//! withholds the operator's entire output on both paths, so both agree on the empty
//! result. The governor identity they report is the one write-once latched trip, so two
//! workers cannot disagree about which governor fired either.
//!
//! # The lift's own budget rule
//!
//! Completing an operator over a truncated child is real work performed **after** the
//! budget is spent. Two rules keep that from making the trip point unpredictable:
//!
//! 1. **The lift is exempt from charging.** It spends no fuel. If it charged, the point
//!    at which a query stops would stop being a pure function of `(query, data, budget)` —
//!    it would also depend on how much lifting happened to be needed above the trip, which
//!    is a property of the plan shape rather than of the budget.
//! 2. **The lift is bounded by the already-committed row count.** An operator that
//!    absorbs a truncated child finishes *its own* computation over the rows already in
//!    hand and **never begins evaluating a child it has not started** ([`Lift::absorb`]
//!    stops the operator through [`Lift::is_truncated`]). Without that second rule a fuel
//!    trip in the left arm of a join would still license a full scan of the right arm, and
//!    the governor would bound nothing.
//!
//! The first rule has a consequence that has to be paid for on the *other* side, or the
//! budget stops being monotone. A node under a truncation passes its whole bag upward for
//! free; a node whose child merely *completed* would, if its own committed-row charge cut
//! that bag, report fewer rows than the free lift reports one unit of budget lower. It
//! did: `SELECT * WHERE { ?s ex:p ?o }` over three edges returned two certified rows at 7
//! fuel and none at 8. So the committed-row charge does not cut — see
//! [`EvalCtx::charge_committed_rows`](crate::eval::EvalCtx::charge_committed_rows) for
//! why cutting an already-materialized bag saves no work and costs the resumption
//! contract. The charges that bound *work* (a `FILTER` predicate not yet run, a `BIND`
//! expression not yet evaluated) still cut, because there the refusal is the bound.
