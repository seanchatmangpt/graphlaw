//! Caller-supplied execution governors for the evaluation tier: configuration
//! ([`QueryGovernors`]), the stop-signal primitive ([`StopSignal`] and its two shipped
//! implementations), live operation-local accounting ([`GovernorState`]), and the
//! content-hashed identity of the charge schedule ([`GOVERNOR_PROFILE_ID`],
//! [`GOVERNOR_PROFILE_VERSION`], [`GOVERNOR_PROFILE_DIGEST`]).
//!
//! `lift` holds the partial-lift channel — the third result an operator can produce,
//! carrying the rows it holds together with a machine-checked statement of what they
//! bound — and `soundness` holds the companion static analysis: the one exhaustive algebra visitor
//! that decides what a truncated bag at a node still certifies about the root answer, and
//! — the same computation read for a different purpose — whether the answer cap may be
//! pushed down to that node.
//!
//! Both are **crate-private on purpose**: their types are generic over the dataset's id
//! type and carry interned solution terms, including terms minted into an execution's
//! scratch arena, which cannot outlive the evaluation context that owns them. What crosses
//! the crate boundary instead is the same certificate restated over materialized rows —
//! [`GovernedOutcome`](crate::GovernedOutcome) and
//! [`PartialAnswers`](crate::PartialAnswers), produced by
//! [`NativeSparqlEngine::query_governed`](crate::NativeSparqlEngine::query_governed). Only
//! [`NonMonotoneBarrier`], which names an operator and owns nothing, is public from here.
//!
//! # A governor never changes an answer, only an outcome
//!
//! A resource ceiling decides whether a caller receives the complete answer or a certified
//! interval plus a typed cause. [`PartialAnswers::Certain`](crate::PartialAnswers::Certain)
//! exposes only proven answers; [`PartialAnswers::AtMost`](crate::PartialAnswers::AtMost)
//! exposes only an upper bound; and [`PartialAnswers::Unknown`](crate::PartialAnswers::Unknown)
//! exposes no rows. That is what separates a governor from semantic optionality: it does
//! not alter the query's complete answer, and it never labels an uncertified row as one.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Charging is deterministic by construction on [`ResourceDimension::Fuel`],
//! [`ResourceDimension::AnswerRows`], and [`ResourceDimension::IntermediateCells`]: the
//! same query over the same data under the same ceilings consumes exactly the same
//! amount and trips at exactly the same point. Parallel evaluation preserves this
//! because charges are accumulated **chunk-locally** ([`ItemCharge`], one record per
//! input row, no atomics and nothing shared) and folded in source-item order
//! ([`GovernorState::commit_ordered_items`]) — the same order-stable reduction
//! `crate::parallel` already uses for errors. A wall-deadline trip is inherently
//! time-dependent and carries no such determinism claim; an injected deadline signal
//! driven by a deterministic poll count does, and the corpus grades that poll schedule.
//!
//! # The schema of a partial result (a stated contract, not an accident)
//!
//! A complete result reports the columns the query produces. A **partial** result reports
//! the columns of the operator arms that were actually evaluated, and for four operators
//! those are not the same thing:
//!
//! | Operator | Truncated arm | Columns reported |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `JOIN`, `OPTIONAL`, `LATERAL`, `UNION` | left | the **left arm's** columns only |
//! | everything else, and the right arm of all four | — | the node's true columns |
//!
//! When the left arm of one of those four truncates, the right arm is deliberately never
//! evaluated — starting a fresh subtree after the budget is spent is unbounded work a
//! governor must not license — and this engine's column ORDER is chosen during
//! evaluation, not parsed off the query: a basic graph pattern's columns appear in the
//! order the cost-based join order visits them. So the right arm's columns are not
//! derivable without doing the work that was just refused, and reporting a guess would be
//! worse than reporting less.
//!
//! No row is affected: in every one of these cases the surviving rows are exactly the
//! left arm's, or none at all. Only the reported column list is narrower than a complete
//! run's, and a caller that diffs column lists across the complete and partial paths must
//! expect that. Where the true schema *is* derivable without the refused work — every
//! unary operator, `MINUS` (whose schema is its left arm's), `PROJECT` (whose schema is
//! its variable list), and `GROUP BY` (grouping variables then aggregate outputs) — the
//! true schema is reported, including when no rows cross at all.
//!
//! # The vocabulary is a kernel type
//!
//! [`StopCause`], [`ResourceDimension`], [`ResourceVector`], [`TrippedGovernor`], and
//! [`GovernorEvidence`] all live in [`purrdf_core`] so that the demand-paging tier and
//! the evaluation tier name one taxonomy. This module adds only the evaluation tier's
//! configuration, live state, and profile identity.

/// these four constants name.
pub const GOVERNOR_PROFILE_ID: &str = "purrdf-sparql-governors";

/// The version of [`GOVERNOR_PROFILE_ID`] this build implements.
///
/// Incremented by any change to what a given query costs, to the precedence order, or to
/// the inclusive-boundary rule — i.e. by any change that could move the point at which a
/// caller's budget trips. A change that cannot move a charge (a refactor, a clearer
/// diagnostic) does not increment it, which is what makes the number worth pinning.
///
/// # v2
///
/// [`CHARGE_SCHEDULE`] is byte-identical to v1 — every point and every cost — so a v1
/// budget still means the same *events*. What changed is how many of those events a
/// governed query performs, on one query shape: an expression-embedded `EXISTS` used to
/// be re-evaluated once per rayon chunk, because each chunk forked a child whose `EXISTS`
/// memo was a snapshot, and the chunk count is derived from the machine's thread count.
/// A governed row loop no longer forks when its expression can re-enter evaluation (see
/// `EvalCtx::may_fork_row_loop`), so the inner
/// pattern is evaluated once. On a 1500-row `FILTER EXISTS` that is 148 597 fuel before
/// and 9 004 after — and, more to the point, 13 507 on one worker versus 57 036 on eight
/// before, versus one number on any machine after. A budget sized against v1 for such a
/// query was sized against the machine that measured it, which is precisely what a pinned
/// profile exists to prevent, so the number moves rather than the guarantee.
///
/// # v3
///
/// [`CHARGE_SCHEDULE`] is again byte-identical — no point moved and no cost changed — and
/// again the *number of events* a query performs did. The answer cap and `LIMIT` are now
/// pushed down the certified prefix-monotone spine — the same certificate
/// [`NonMonotoneBarrier`] is the negative half of — so a leaf under a row ceiling stops
/// scanning at the ceiling instead of materialising its whole output and having it cut at
/// the root.
/// `SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10` over a million quads used to charge a million
/// `bgp-candidate-quad` points and then discard all but ten rows; it now charges eleven.
/// Every answer is unchanged — the pushdown is licensed by the same certificate that
/// governs partial answers, and the pushed ceiling is one row above the cap precisely so
/// the cap can still tell "exactly full" from "overflowed" — but a budget sized against v2
/// for a `LIMIT`ed query was sized against work this build no longer does, so the number
/// moves.
///
/// v3 also adds [`TrippedGovernor::Refused`], which can stop an execution before its first
/// charge, and applies the answer cap to `CONSTRUCT` and `DESCRIBE` output statements.
/// Neither changes a charge; both change which executions reach one.
///
/// # v4
///
/// The first version in which [`CHARGE_SCHEDULE`] is **not** byte-identical to v1: it gains
/// [`ChargePoint::UpdateMutatedQuad`], because SPARQL `UPDATE` became governable
/// (`NativeSparqlEngine::update_governed`) and a mutation is work a budget has to be able
/// to bound. `CLEAR ALL`, `MOVE`, `COPY`, `ADD`, `LOAD` and the `DATA` forms do work
/// proportional to the *store*, not to the request text, and none of it passes through an
/// algebra node — so without this point a caller could set every ceiling on this crate and
/// still have `CLEAR ALL` run to completion over a hundred million quads, reporting zero
/// consumption. A ceiling that a whole operation kind cannot reach is not a ceiling.
///
/// No *query* charges it: a query mutates nothing, so a budget sized against v3 for a query
/// buys exactly the same execution under v4. The number moves anyway, because the schedule
/// moved and the schedule is what the digest describes.
///
/// # v5
///
/// [`CHARGE_SCHEDULE`] gains two points, because the evaluator gained a second producer
/// whose bag size an outside party picks: a **property-function call**
/// ([`crate::property_fn::PropertyFunction`]) invokes host code from predicate position and
/// ingests whatever rows that host relation chooses to emit.
///
/// - [`ChargePoint::PropertyFunctionInvocation`] is charged once per relation invocation —
///   once per driving row, the unit of work a relation actually performs.
/// - [`ChargePoint::PropertyFunctionRow`] is charged once per emitted row admitted into the
///   call's bag, through the same governed ingest core `SERVICE` charges
///   [`ChargePoint::RemoteRowIngested`] through.
///
/// Without them a call's whole cost rode the generic per-node accounting every algebra node
/// pays — one [`ChargePoint::AlgebraNodeEntry`] on the way in and one
/// [`ChargePoint::CommittedOutputRow`] per committed row on the way out — which prices a
/// relation that emits a million rows from one invocation exactly as it prices one that
/// emits ten, and prices a thousand invocations that each emit nothing at nothing at all. A
/// ceiling that cannot see the work a host relation performs is not a ceiling on it.
///
/// No query without a registered property function charges either point, so a budget sized
/// against v4 for such a query buys exactly the same execution under v5. The number moves
/// anyway, because the schedule moved and the schedule is what the digest describes.
///
/// v5 also teaches admission control to price a call: a property-function node contributes
/// [`PropertyFunction::rows_per_invocation`](crate::property_fn::PropertyFunction::rows_per_invocation)
/// to the plan survey (see `crate::bgp::survey_pattern_plans`), so a relation that declares a
/// bound above the caller's cell ceiling is refused before it opens a cursor rather than
/// metered while it fills memory.
///
/// # v6
///
/// [`CHARGE_SCHEDULE`] gains two more points, because an aggregate — `COUNT`, `SUM`,
/// `GROUP_CONCAT`, every other built-in in `crate::modifier`'s fold, and every registered
/// [`crate::agg_fn::CustomAggregate`] alike — is a **third** producer whose per-group work an
/// outside party (the data, not the plan) sizes, and until v6 that work was as invisible to
/// the schedule as a property-function relation's was before v5: a `GROUP_CONCAT` folding a
/// million rows into one group priced at roughly one `algebra-node-entry` plus one
/// `committed-output-row`, exactly as a `GROUP_CONCAT` folding ten did.
///
/// - [`ChargePoint::AggregateInvocation`] is charged once per `(group, aggregate expression)`
///   pair — the fold's init/finish overhead, charged uniformly whether the expression folds
///   through the built-in `crate::modifier` path or dispatches to a registered
///   [`crate::agg_fn::CustomAggregate`], because both instantiate the same init/step/finish
///   shape and a caller's budget should not need to know which one a given aggregate function
///   happens to be.
/// - [`ChargePoint::AggregateAccumulation`] is charged once per value a group folds — once per
///   `step` call the fold path would make, including a value `DISTINCT` later discards: the
///   work of producing that value (evaluating its argument expression, or its custom-aggregate
///   argument tuple) and inspecting it against the running `DISTINCT` set already happened by
///   the time the dedup check runs, so the charge is placed before that check rather than
///   after it.
///
/// Both points are charged from the one dispatch path `crate::modifier::eval_aggregate` and
/// `crate::modifier::eval_custom_aggregate` share, so a built-in and a custom aggregate over
/// the same shape of group cost the same fuel. No query without an aggregate charges either
/// point, so a budget sized against v5 for such a query buys exactly the same execution under
/// v6. The number moves anyway, because the schedule moved and the schedule is what the
/// digest describes.
///
/// # v7
///
/// [`CHARGE_SCHEDULE`] gains three points: deterministic evidence for which of the
/// evaluator's two `EXISTS`/`NOT EXISTS` strategies (`crate::enf`'s module doc states the
/// one-definition theorem the two implement) answered a given site, and how much of the
/// per-row definition path's inner bag a governed evaluation actually consumed.
///
/// - [`ChargePoint::ExistsProbeAnswered`] is charged once per DISTINCT memoized-probe
///   evaluation (an `exists_inner_cache` miss) — not once per outer row a shared index
///   answers, so `k` distinct sites/schemas evaluated under the probe strategy across `N`
///   outer rows charge this point `k` times, never `N`.
/// - [`ChargePoint::ExistsDefinitionAnswered`] is the per-row definition path's twin,
///   charged once per DISTINCT μ-restriction memo evaluation (an `exists_definition_memo`
///   miss) — `k` distinct correlated-variable restrictions across `N` outer rows charge
///   this point `k` times, never `N`. See `crate::expr::exists`'s doc for the memo's
///   `(pattern, graph, schema, restriction)` key and its per-evaluation lifecycle.
/// - [`ChargePoint::ExistsInnerSolutionsConsumed`] is charged once per row the definition
///   path's substituted-and-first-witness-wrapped inner actually materializes, for each
///   `ExistsDefinitionAnswered` evaluation — bounded at 1 by the `Slice{0, Some(1)}` wrap
///   (`crate::enf`'s module doc, "truncated-at-one-witness is complete for emptiness") in
///   every production evaluation; a differential test seam evaluates the unwrapped control
///   to observe the un-truncated count instead.
///
/// No query without a correlated `EXISTS`/`NOT EXISTS` charges any of the three, so a
/// budget sized against v6 for such a query buys exactly the same execution under v7. The
/// number moves anyway, because the schedule moved and the schedule is what the digest
/// describes.
///
/// # v8
///
/// [`CHARGE_SCHEDULE`] gains one point,
/// [`ChargePoint::PropertyFunctionWork`], because v5 priced a host relation by the two
/// quantities the *engine* can see — how many times it was asked, and how many rows it
/// handed back — and for a whole class of relation neither of those is where the work is.
/// A nearest-neighbour search over a million vectors that returns the five closest costs
/// one `property-function-invocation` and five `property-function-row`s: six units for a
/// million distance computations, priced identically to a six-row table scan. A budget is
/// then a number about the answer's size rather than about the execution, which is the
/// thing a governor exists to bound.
///
/// The point is charged from the quantity the relation itself reports through
/// [`PfCursor::take_work`](crate::property_fn::PfCursor::take_work) — the only party that
/// can see inside its own search. Three properties keep that from being a budget-evasion
/// channel or a budget-fabrication one:
///
/// - It is charged, not trusted-and-ignored: the engine multiplies the reported count by
///   this point's cost and spends it, so a relation that over-reports exhausts its
///   caller's budget and a relation that under-reports is still bounded by every other
///   ceiling in force (the invocation point, the row point, the intermediate-cell peak,
///   the wall deadline). Under-reporting can make a query *cheaper* than it should be; it
///   cannot make one *unsound*, and no engine-side measure can see inside host code to do
///   better.
/// - It is read after every pull, including the terminating one, so a cursor that does its
///   work lazily and a cursor that does it all in `open` are charged the same total.
/// - It defaults to zero. Every relation written against v5's seam — including
///   [`MemoryRelation`](crate::property_fn::MemoryRelation) — reports no work and charges
///   nothing, so a budget sized against v7 for such a query buys exactly the same
///   execution under v8. The number moves anyway, because the schedule moved and the
///   schedule is what the digest describes.
pub const GOVERNOR_PROFILE_VERSION: u32 = 8;

/// The charge schedule, as data rather than as scattered literals.

/// `EXISTS`-strategy evidence points, and v8 appends `property-function-work` — see
/// [`GOVERNOR_PROFILE_VERSION`] for what each version moved and why.
///
/// Each entry is `(label, cost)`. The labels are a pinned contract — a frozen corpus and

/// edit. [`ChargePoint`] is the type-safe index into this table; the table is the single

///
/// Every charge point costs one unit in v1. That is deliberate: a schedule whose costs

/// So are `property-function-invocation` (one call into a host relation),
/// `property-function-row` (one row that relation emitted and this engine accepted),
/// `aggregate-invocation` (one group folding one aggregate expression),

/// `exists-probe-answered` (one memoized-probe evaluation), `exists-definition-answered`
/// (one per-row-definition evaluation), and `exists-inner-solutions-consumed` (one row the

/// internal work a relation performed and reported, in whatever unit that relation's own
/// documentation names (a distance computation, a posting scanned). The engine cannot
/// define that unit for host code, so it prices it at one and lets the relation say how
/// many; what makes the number comparable across relations is that each one documents its
/// unit, not that the engine imposed one.
