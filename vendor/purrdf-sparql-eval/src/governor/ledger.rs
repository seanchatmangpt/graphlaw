//! The per-node charge ledger: where every unit of fuel went, which node committed which
//! rows, and — where the planner produced a number — what it predicted beside what
//! happened.
//!
//! # Why a ledger at all
//!
//! [`GovernorEvidence`](purrdf_core::GovernorEvidence) reports one number per dimension
//! for a whole execution. That is the right shape for *sizing* a budget and the wrong
//! shape for *understanding* one: "this query cost 4.2 million fuel" does not say which
//! operator spent it, and a caller whose budget is too small has no way to tell a
//! genuinely expensive query from a mis-planned one. The ledger is the per-node
//! decomposition of that single number, and [`QueryExplanation`] is how it is read.
//!
//! It is also the only place the cost planner's error becomes observable. `bgp`'s
//! cost-based join order minimises an *estimated* intermediate cardinality; nothing
//! previously compared that estimate to the cardinality that actually materialised. A
//! ledger row carries both, so an estimator that is wrong by three orders of magnitude
//! says so in the EXPLAIN output rather than only in a query's wall time.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Same query, same data, same budget ⇒ byte-identical ledger. Three properties buy that:
//!
//! 1. **Node identity is positional, not addressed.** A node's ordinal is its position in
//!    [`walk_spine`](super::soundness::walk_spine)'s pre-order over the plan, which is a
//!    pure function of the algebra. Addresses are used only to *find* that ordinal during
//!    evaluation and never appear in output.
//! 2. **The totals are sums, and addition commutes.** A forked worker charges the same
//!    node its parent was charging (the node cursor is copied into the fork, not reset),
//!    so the per-node total is independent of how the work was split across workers even
//!    though the interleaving is not.
//! 3. **Nothing here reads a clock.** The deadline governor is the one clock reader in the
//!    evaluator and it stays that way, which is also what keeps this
//!    `wasm32-unknown-unknown`-clean.
//!
//! # What is *not* in the ledger
//!
//! Charges an ungoverned execution never made. The ledger records what the schedule
//! charged, so it fills only when the corresponding dimension is engaged — which is why
//! [`NativeSparqlEngine::explain_query`](crate::NativeSparqlEngine::explain_query) runs
//! under [`QueryGovernors::METERED`](super::QueryGovernors::METERED): every counter
//! engaged, at a ceiling nothing can reach.
//!
//! # Attribution of work that is not a plan node
//!
//! An expression-embedded `EXISTS` re-enters whole-pattern evaluation, and a correlated
//! one does so over a *substituted temporary* tree that is allocated per outer row and
//! dropped at the end of it. Those nodes are not in the plan, so they have no ordinal. The
//! cursor therefore only moves when a node is a **known plan node**, and everything else
//! accrues to the nearest enclosing one — the `FILTER` or `BIND` that owns the expression.
//! That is what makes the ledger's fuel total equal the evidence's fuel total exactly,
//! rather than approximately — a decomposition that did not add up would be a
//! decomposition of some other number. The governed-query surface tests check it by
//! summing every ledger line's fuel column against
//! [`GovernorEvidence::consumed_in`](purrdf_core::GovernorEvidence::consumed_in) for
//! [`ResourceDimension::Fuel`](purrdf_core::ResourceDimension::Fuel).
//!
//! # What `rows`/`cells` measure, and why that is not the same rule as fuel's
//!
//! A `LATERAL` right operand is evaluated once per left row through a *per-row substituted
//! copy* of the real plan node (`crate::binop::eval_correlated`), and a `Bgp`/`Path` leaf
//! that copy touches is, by Values-Insertion's design, wrapped `Join(leaf, Values{…})`
//! rather than having its own triple patterns rewritten to ground terms (`crate::expr`'s
//! `substitute_pattern` doc) — so ONE substituted evaluation of a real `Bgp` node produces
//! THREE separate committed-output events under the same ledger line: the leaf's own
//! UNCONSTRAINED re-scan, the one-row `VALUES` table's own always-one-row output, and the
//! `Join`'s NARROWED result. All three did real work and all three charge fuel here — fuel
//! meters *work*, every unit charged during the substituted evaluation belongs to this
//! node and nowhere else, and the sum-to-total invariant above depends on that.
//!
//! `rows` (and, downstream of it, `cells` and the rendered `actual-rows`) is a different
//! question: not "how much work happened here" but "what did this node's evaluation
//! PRODUCE". For a `Bgp` under `LATERAL`, the answer a caller comparing `estimated-rows`
//! against `actual-rows` needs is the SAME quantity the planner sized — the node's
//! constrained, post-injection output — which is exactly the wrapping `Join`'s result, not
//! the leaf's unconstrained re-scan and not the `Values` table's bookkeeping. Committing
//! all three into `rows` (the pre-fix behaviour) makes it a composite of three different
//! nodes' outputs printed beside an estimate that predicts only one of them — a real `Bgp`
//! whose planner estimate was EXACT then renders as an apparent order-of-magnitude miss.
//! `crate::expr::SubstitutionSource::counts_rows` is the per-synthesized-node flag that
//! keeps `rows`/`cells` counting only ONE node's output as the real node's true output for
//! that row — while every synthesized node's fuel keeps landing here regardless.
//!
//! For a single (non-nested) `LATERAL` window that one counting node is simply the wrapper
//! when Values Insertion adds one, or a plain 1:1 copy when it does not. A `LATERAL` nested
//! inside another `LATERAL`'s per-row substituted copy raises the same question one level
//! deeper: the inner window's own substitution walk re-copies the OUTER window's
//! already-wrapped subtree — the leaf, the `VALUES` table, AND the outer `Join` wrapper —
//! and each re-copy, considered only against the inner window's OWN local rule, looks like
//! an independent node with its own claim to count. Rewarding every one of them (the
//! pre-fix behaviour) commits the same real ordinal's rows several times over — a `Bgp`
//! whose true constrained output is 2 rows can render `actual-rows` several multiples of
//! that beside an `estimated-rows` that was exact. The rule that avoids it, stated
//! precisely: **within one substitution window, for each real plan ordinal, exactly one
//! synthesized or copied node counts rows — the first node the window's bottom-up walk
//! mints for that ordinal that is not later demoted to scaffolding.** That survivor is the
//! lowest undemoted node of the synthesized chain (the wrapped leaf hands its claim to the
//! `Join` wrapper minted directly above it); the copies minted above the survivor re-apply
//! an identical `VALUES` binding — the scope rule forbids the right-hand side rebinding an
//! outer variable — so they cannot narrow the result further, and the survivor's committed
//! output already equals the fully-constrained result the planner's estimate refers to.
//! Letting any node above it also count would double-count that same result. See
//! `crate::expr::SubstitutionSource`'s doc for how the walk enforces this — resolving each
//! copy's source past its own enclosing window at construction time and letting only the
//! first-minted copy per real ordinal, per window, keep the claim — and
//! `crate::eval::EvalCtx::ledger_counts_rows` for the evaluator-side cursor that carries
//! the already-arbitrated answer through to the commit.
//!
//! `rows` sums every commit this node's ledger line receives (its total output, however
//! many times the node was invoked); `cells` keeps only the largest single commit (the
//! peak one materialized bag ever held — see [`ChargeLedger::record_cells`]). A node
//! invoked exactly once therefore always shows `cells == rows * columns`; a node invoked
//! several times can show `cells < rows * columns` whenever more than one invocation
//! committed a nonzero row (the peak of several nonnegative numbers is never more than
//! their sum) — never more, since a violation of `cells <= rows * columns` would mean
//! `rows` and `cells` on the same line describe two different row sets rather than the
//! same one.
