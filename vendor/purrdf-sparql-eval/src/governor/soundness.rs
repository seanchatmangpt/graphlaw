//! The one exhaustive algebra visitor, and the two answers it computes: whether a
//! truncated bag at a node still certifies a bound on the root answer, and whether the
//! operational answer cap may be pushed down to that node.
//!
//! # Why one visitor
//!
//! Three analyses need the same structural walk over [`GraphPattern`] — the fork-join
//! parallel-safety gate ([`crate::parallel`]), the answer-completeness certificate, and
//! the answer-cap pushdown licence — and all three need it to descend into
//! [`Expression`]s as well, because `FILTER`/`BIND`/`ORDER BY`/aggregates all carry
//! patterns inside expressions (`EXISTS`) and builtins inside expressions. Written three
//! times, a new algebra variant would need three independent edits and only some of them
//! would be found. The walk is therefore defined exactly once, here, in
//! [`visit_pattern_parts`] and [`visit_expression_parts`]; [`crate::parallel`]'s
//! unsafe-builtin search is expressed in terms of it.
//!
//! # The formalism: prefix-monotonicity, not subset-monotonicity
//!
//! Evaluation is fully materialized and its parallel reduce is order-stable, so a
//! truncated bag is a **prefix of the true bag in evaluation order**, not merely a subset
//! of it. That distinction is load-bearing rather than pedantic:
//!
//! ```text
//! true bag   = [a, b]
//! partial    = [b]        -- a subset, but NOT a prefix
//! LIMIT 1    -> partial gives [b], true gives [a]
//! ```
//!
//! `Slice(0, 1)` is not subset-monotone, so a subset certificate would license emitting
//! `b` for a query whose only answer is `a`. It **is** prefix-preserving, so the prefix
//! certificate licenses nothing false. Every classification below is stated in terms of
//! prefixes for exactly this reason.
//!
//! # Two axes, because two different things can be lost
//!
//! A truncation can cost the *positional* relation while keeping the *multiset* relation.
//! `ORDER BY` is the obvious case — sorting a prefix of the input yields a sub-bag of the
//! sorted output, in a different order — but it is not the only one. Under a hash join
//! whose output is left-major, truncating the **right** input removes rows from the
//! middle of the output, not from its end; under `UNION`, whose output is the left rows
//! followed by the right rows, truncating the **left** input does the same. Those
//! operators still deliver a sound multiset lower bound, and they still must not be
//! trusted positionally.
//!
//! So each child edge carries both a [`ChildRole`] (which side of the answer interval the
//! child's truncation bounds) and a [`PrefixFidelity`] (whether the positional prefix
//! relation survives it), and [`SpineContext`] tracks [`SpineClass`] and
//! [`OrderCertainty`] separately.
//!
//! # The interaction that is easiest to get wrong
//!
//! A node that selects its output **by position** — a restricting `Slice` — needs its
//! input to be a genuine prefix. Given only a sub-bag it can select rows the true query
//! never returns:
//!
//! ```text
//! ORDER BY ?x LIMIT 1  over  true bag [a, b]
//! partial sub-bag [b] -> LIMIT 1 gives [b]; the true answer is [a]
//! ```
//!
//! So [`SpineContext`] carries a bit recording that a restricting `Slice` lies above on
//! this spine, and any edge below it that is only [`PrefixFidelity::BagOnly`] collapses to
//! [`SpineClass::Unknown`]. This is what makes `ORDER BY` + `LIMIT` a top-*k* problem with
//! no certified lower bound, and it applies identically to a `MINUS` right arm under a
//! `LIMIT` (an upper bound is not a prefix either, so slicing it selects the wrong rows).
//!
//! # `EXISTS` is opaque, deliberately
//!
//! An `EXISTS` pattern reached through an expression is classified
//! [`ChildRole::Opaque`], and so is a `NOT EXISTS` one — `NOT EXISTS` is
//! `Not(Exists(..))` in this algebra, so the two are not even distinguishable without
//! tracking negation polarity through `!`, `IF`, `COALESCE`, `IN`, and user-function
//! bodies.
//!
//! The reasoning for refusing both: truncating an `EXISTS` inner bag can only turn its
//! boolean from true to false, so a `FILTER EXISTS` drops rows the true query keeps —
//! from the **middle** of its output, which is a sub-bag and not a prefix. Truncating a
//! `NOT EXISTS` inner bag turns its boolean from false to true, which **fabricates** rows
//! the true query never returns; that is not a bound in either direction. A single
//! classification must cover both, and only [`ChildRole::Opaque`] is sound for both.
//! Withholding rows costs utility; admitting a fabricated row costs correctness, and the
//! certificate exists to make that trade in exactly one direction.
//!
//! Note the scope: it is truncation **inside** the `EXISTS` subtree that is opaque. A
//! `FILTER`'s own data child stays [`ChildRole::PrefixMonotone`], because the filter
//! predicate is then evaluated in full over a prefix and yields a prefix.
//!
//! # Enforcement
//!
//! **Every `match` over [`GraphPattern`], [`Expression`], and [`OrderExpression`] in
//! this module is wildcard-free — no `_ =>` arm, and every field of every variant is
//! named.** A new algebra variant, or a new field on an existing one, must therefore
//! be a compile error (E0004) here rather than silently inheriting the most
//! permissive classification, which is [`SpineClass::Certain`] — i.e. rather than
//! silently licensing partial rows to cross as answers. This mirrors the enforcement
//! idiom `purrdf_sparql_conformance`'s OWL-RL
//! scoreboard uses for the same reason: an unclassified case counted as a neighbour
//! prints a figure that is not what it says it is.
//!
//! (`purrdf_sparql_algebra::AggregateExpression` is a struct, not an enum, so it has
//! no variants to match over; its `args` exprlist is walked directly by field access
//! instead — see the `GraphPattern::Group` arm below — so the same "no silent
//! fallthrough" property holds without needing a match at all.)

// The certificate is a pure function of the algebra and holds no evaluator types, which
// is what lets it be exercised against hand-built plans (see this module's tests) rather
// than only through whole-query evaluation — a certificate that can only be observed
// through the thing it licenses is a certificate nobody can falsify.

// # Why a sibling walk, not a fourth [`PatternPart`]/[`ExpressionPart`] output
//
// This module's header calls [`visit_pattern_parts`]/[`visit_expression_parts`]
// "the one exhaustive algebra visitor" three analyses already share. This is a
// FOURTH analysis, and it does NOT route through that visitor — deliberately, and
// for a structural reason rather than an oversight: [`visit_pattern_parts`] is a
// SHALLOW, callback-driven, boolean-search shape (`FnMut(PatternPart) -> bool`,
// stopping at the first `true`) built for the three consumers that all ask a
// yes/no question (is there an unsafe builtin anywhere? does a truncation certify
// a bound?). [`NodeAnalysis`] below is not a search — it SYNTHESIZES a value (two
// variable sets and a bool) bottom-up from each node's children and combines them
// with a PER-VARIANT rule (`Join` unions, `Union` intersects, `LeftJoin` keeps only
// the left, …), which a single shallow callback cannot express: the combination
// rule needs the CHILDREN'S OWN computed [`NodeAnalysis`] values in hand, not just
// a bool for whether visiting them would stop early.
//
// What IS preserved from that module's doctrine, verbatim: [`analyze_pattern`] and
// [`analyze_expr`] below are EXHAUSTIVE, WILDCARD-FREE matches over every
// [`GraphPattern`]/[`Expression`] variant with every field named, for the identical
// reason this module's header states — a new algebra variant must be a compile
// error here, not a silent inheritance of the most permissive classification. Kept
// in the SAME FILE as the shared visitor (rather than a new module) so the
// relationship — one doctrine, two walk shapes, for a principled reason — stays
// visible beside it.

///   [`EvalError`](crate::EvalError)) leaves the target unbound per SPARQL §18.6,
///   not bound to some value. This analysis has no per-expression-shape way to
///   know whether `expression` can type-error.
/// * `Group` inserts every aggregate output variable into `certainly_bound`
///   UNCONDITIONALLY — but `MIN`/`MAX`/`SAMPLE` over a group whose every input row
///   errors on the aggregate's own argument expression yields NO value for that
///   output variable, not some value.
///
/// **Which claims over-approximate**: exactly those two — every other bullet above
/// derives `certainly_bound` from a guarantee the algebra shape itself gives (a
/// `Bgp` match, a `VALUES` column with no `UNDEF`, a `Join`'s both-sides
/// requirement, …), never from an unproven "this expression cannot error"
/// assumption.
///
/// **Which callers neutralize them**: neither over-claim can currently decide a
/// [`probe_admissible`] outcome, because [`admissible_rec`] never reads it in a
/// context where the claim's truth would matter:
///
/// * [`admissible_rec`]'s `Extend` arm's `&&` chain includes
///   `!current_row_vars.contains(variable)` as an independent leg, checked
///   alongside (not gated behind) the `expr_probe_admissible` call that would read
///   an ENCLOSING node's lookup of this `Extend` node's own over-claimed
///   `certainly_bound`. The over-claim can only change an outcome when
///   `variable ∈ current_row_vars` — exactly the case where that collision leg
///   already forces the whole `Extend` arm (and, by `&&`-chaining, every ancestor
///   that recurses through it) to `false`, short-circuiting before the
///   over-claimed value is ever consulted.
/// * [`admissible_rec`]'s `Group` arm is a blanket
///   `GraphPattern::Group { .. } => false` — `Group` is NEVER probe-admissible, so
///   no ancestor's `admissible_rec(inner, ..) && expr_probe_admissible(..,
///   node_analysis(inner, ..).certainly_bound, ..)` call ever evaluates the
///   `expr_probe_admissible` half of that `&&` when `inner` is a `Group` node:
///   `&&` short-circuits on the `false` the blanket refusal already produced.
///
/// **What a future consumer must check**: a new caller of `certainly_bound`
/// OUTSIDE `probe_admissible`'s recursion — or any change to either neutralizing
/// arm above — must not trust an `Extend` target or a `Group` aggregate output as
/// unconditionally bound without re-deriving one of the two guards this doc note
/// describes (a collision check that forces refusal exactly when the over-claim
/// could matter, or a blanket refusal of the whole node). The precise fix —
/// conditioning the two insertions on whether `expression`/the aggregate's
/// argument can type-error — is deliberately NOT attempted here: SPARQL's "type
/// error leaves unbound" rule is a per-expression-shape judgment `analyze_expr`
/// does not currently make, so doing this exactly would need a new, third boolean

///   `VALUES` row and re-matching would produce, because the leaf's own match is
///   independent of anything but the dataset and μ's OWN bound columns. Always
///   admissible.
/// * `Values`: admissible UNLESS one of its OWN columns collides with a
///   current-row variable — SEP-0007 forbids an `EXISTS` body rebinding a variable
///   already in scope on the row it filters (and this engine's parser now refuses
///   exactly that at parse time — see `find_scope_conflict`'s doc), so a real
///   collision should never reach this predicate on parsed input, but this check
///   is stated independently of that parser guarantee (never lean on the parser)
///   because `probe_admissible` also runs over hand-built algebra (SHACL/chase
///   rewrites, unit tests) the parser never saw. A column NOT in `outer_schema` is
///   genuinely fresh — no outer row could ever supply a value under that name — and
///   admits.
/// * `PropertyFunction`: never admissible. A relation's argument is an invocation
///   INPUT the evaluator reads from the CURRENT row (`crate::property_fn_eval`),
///   not a join key a post-hoc `VALUES` probe can supply — the same "fusion
///   contract" `crate::expr::substitute_term_pattern`'s doc states for why
///   substitution rewrites property-function arguments literally rather than via
///   Values Insertion. Evaluating the call once, unconstrained, and probing its
///   output afterward is not equivalent to invoking it WITH μ's own arguments.
/// * `Graph`: admissible iff the inner is (the graph-name column, when `?g` is a
///   variable, already lands in the node's own schema per Part 3's pinning, and
///   the shared-column probe covers it exactly like any other column).
/// * `Join`/`Union`: admissible iff BOTH operands are — each operand's own probe
///   is independent of the other's.
/// * `Filter`/`Extend`: admissible iff the inner is, AND [`expr_probe_admissible`]
///   accepts the filter/bind expression against the inner's own certainly-bound
///   set, AND (`Extend` only) the target is not itself a current-row variable
///   (SEP-0007's rebinding rule again, checked independently of the parser for
///   the same reason as `Values`, above). A target NOT in `outer_schema` is fresh
///   and admits, for the same reason as `Values`.
/// * `OrderBy`/`Project`/`Distinct`/`Reduced`: admissible iff the inner is — none
///   of the four can change whether a ROW exists, only its order, its column set,
///   or whether a duplicate survives, none of which the shared-column probe
///   (an existence-only question) is sensitive to.
/// * `LeftJoin` (an off-spine survivor — the ENF laws already erased every
///   top-of-spine occurrence), `Minus`, `Slice` (ANY — not only a restricting
///   offset: even `Slice(0, k)` picks a `k`-row PREFIX of whatever the correlated
///   variable's specific value produced, which the shared-column probe's
///   evaluate-ONCE-unconstrained pass cannot reproduce per row), `Group`,
///   `Lateral`, and `Service` (a variable endpoint needs per-row resolution to a
