/// `1.2-basic` request that stays inside the profile evaluates exactly as a
/// `1.2` one would, and one that does not is refused here, before any work is
/// spent.
///
/// # Why a declared `VERSION` does not subtract this engine's extensions
///
/// A declared version selects **semantics**, not a feature whitelist. This
/// engine ships documented first-party extensions that SPARQL 1.2 does not
/// define — most visibly the quad-producing `CONSTRUCT` template
/// (`CONSTRUCT GRAPH VarOrIri …` and `GRAPH … { … }` blocks inside a template;
/// see [`purrdf_sparql_algebra::Query::Construct`]) — and a request that
/// declares `VERSION "1.2"` and then uses one is **admitted**, deliberately.
/// Three reasons, in descending force:
///
/// 1. **Refusing here would invert the specification's own conformance chain.**
///    §4.3.1 states that a query conforming to `"1.2-basic"` also conforms to
///    `"1.2"`, so the language `"1.2"` admits must be a *superset* of the one
///    `"1.2-basic"` admits. [`crate::basic_profile`] gates exactly the
///    triple-term feature area the §4.3.1 table's "Syntax" column names, and
///    nothing else, so a quad template is admitted under `"1.2-basic"`.
///    Refusing it under `"1.2"` would make the narrower profile accept a query
///    the wider one rejects — an incoherence no author could reason about. The
///    only coherent way to refuse would be to gate the extension under
///    `"1.2-basic"` too, which would mean inventing a restriction the profile's
///    quoted spec text does not state.
/// 2. **The declaration would otherwise become a semantic switch.** Every
///    version label this engine recognizes evaluates the same algebra on the
///    same engine; an undeclared-version request already admits the extension.
///    If the *presence* of a `VERSION "1.2"` line subtracted capability, the
///    same query text would mean two different things depending on a line whose
///    specified job is to name semantics — per-request optionality of exactly
///    the kind this project forbids. One engine, one behavior.
/// 3. **The extension is conservative.** A quad template with no graph slot
///    filled is byte-identically the SPARQL 1.1 §16.2 template, so no
///    spec-conformant query's meaning is changed by the extension existing. It
///    adds a spelling; it redefines nothing.
///
/// The fail-fast boundary this function *does* enforce is the one that protects
/// meaning rather than vocabulary: an **unrecognized** label names semantics
/// this engine cannot honor, so it is refused outright rather than evaluated
/// under a guess. That is the hard failure; refusing a first-party spelling
/// whose semantics are known and additive is not.
