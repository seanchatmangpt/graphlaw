//! Basic-graph-pattern (BGP) evaluation — the TermId hot path.
//!
//! A BGP is a conjunction of triple patterns. Evaluation stays entirely in
//! interned [`TermId`](purrdf_core::TermId) space:
//!
//! 1. **Compile** each triple pattern's three positions to either a [`Pos::Slot`]
//!    (a variable column) or a [`Pos::Bound`] (a ground constant resolved once via
//!    `term_id_by_value`, the P4 reverse index). If a ground constant is absent from
//!    the dataset the whole BGP is empty — that constant cannot match.
//! 2. **Order** the patterns cheapest-first with a cost-based join planner
//!    ([`cost_based_order`]): probe each pattern's real cardinality through the P4
//!    lazy permutation index and search join orders (exhaustive left-deep DP for a
//!    small BGP, greedy beyond) to minimise the estimated total intermediate
//!    cardinality, keeping the join connected.
//! 3. **Index-nested-loop join** in that order; for each partial solution, substitute
//!    its already-bound variables into the next pattern's positions and call the
//!    indexed P4 `quads_for_pattern`, then extend. Repeated variables (`?x p ?x`) and
//!    previously-bound variables are enforced at bind time.
//!
//! ## Blank nodes are non-distinguished variables
//!
//! A blank node in a query BGP (`_:b`) is *not* a request to match a specific
//! dataset blank by label — it is an anonymous variable that matches any term and
//! co-refers (by label) **only within this BGP** (SPARQL §4.1.4 / §18.2.1). So a
//! blank position compiles to a synthetic slot variable whose name carries a `NUL`
//! prefix (which the SPARQL grammar can never produce, so it cannot collide with a
//! real `?var`). After the BGP is evaluated these synthetic columns are
//! **projected away**, so two independent BGPs that happen to reuse the label `_:b`
//! never accidentally share a join variable.

/// is exactly the shape a cardinality ceiling exists to refuse.
///
/// # How a property-function call is priced, and what that composition rule is
///
/// A call's output bag is not predicted from the dataset — no index sized it — so its
/// prediction is the relation's own declaration,
/// [`PropertyFunction::rows_per_invocation`](crate::property_fn::PropertyFunction::rows_per_invocation),
/// read for the access pattern the call is *actually* invoked in (the plan has already been
/// feasibility-ordered, so that pattern is fixed by the time this walk runs).
///
/// The composition rule is stated exactly, because the survey has **no cross-node
/// arithmetic at all**: [`PlanSurvey::peak_cells`] is a maximum over per-node peaks, and a
/// `Join` of two basic graph patterns composes to neither node's product. So:
///
/// - A call contributes `rows_per_invocation(mode) × driving_rows` as its own peak, where
///   `driving_rows` is the row count predicted for its **immediate left arm** — the bag it
///   is invoked once per row of — when that arm is a node this walk predicts at all (a
///   basic graph pattern, or the chain spine ending in another call). It is `1` otherwise,
///   which is the truth for a call with nothing written before it and an honest
///   under-count for a driving arm nothing predicts. An under-estimate costs a caller
///   nothing: the live cell ceiling is still in force and still trips.
/// - Its `columns` is the relation's flattened arity — the number of positions it fills on
///   every row it emits. That is a declared quantity rather than a schema this walk would
///   have to derive, and it is never zero, so a call can never be denominated out of a
///   cell-denominated ceiling entirely.
///
/// A call whose IRI resolves against no supplied registry contributes nothing, exactly as
/// every other unpredictable leaf does; evaluation refuses that query on its own terms.
