//! The native [`SparqlEngine`] implementation and its parse-memoizing plan cache.
//!
//! [`NativeSparqlEngine`] is the single required impl of the `purrdf-core`
//! `SparqlEngine` seam — the native replacement for the oxigraph-family
//! `spareval` on the query path. Ordinary query entry points accept operationally
//! infallible [`DatasetView`] backends such as [`RdfDataset`] and validated pack
//! views. Lazy backends that can fail during execution use the distinct
//! [`FallibleDatasetView`] entry points, which return a completeness certificate or
//! a typed operational failure with evidence.
//!
//! One entry point per outcome type, and per-call governors only. The ordinary `query*`
//! methods are exactly ungoverned and exactly complete; a caller that wants execution
//! ceilings names them at the call
//! ([`NativeSparqlEngine::query_governed`]) and receives a [`GovernedOutcome`], which
//! distinguishes a complete result from an exhausted budget with certified partial
//! answers. No governor state is ever held on the engine.
//!
//! The bounded [`PlanCache`] memoizes parsing and registry admission. Callers can
//! also prepare compiler-produced algebra directly and share its immutable plan
//! across worker-local engines without retaining a global evaluation lock.
