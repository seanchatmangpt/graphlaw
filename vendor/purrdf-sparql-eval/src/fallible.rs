//! Public result boundary for operationally fallible SPARQL execution.
//!
//! Ordinary resident and validated-pack queries keep returning
//! `Result<SparqlResult, RdfDiagnostic>`. A lazy view whose reads can fail instead
//! uses [`FallibleSparqlResult`]: only a final ready checkpoint yields
//! [`CompleteSparqlResult`], while an ordinary query diagnostic, a typed operational root
//! cause, or an exhausted execution budget carries the evidence accumulated by that
//! execution.
//!
//! Internal partial rows never cross this boundary. A governed execution's partial answers
//! do — but only after being materialized into the ordinary egress model and labelled with
//! what they bound ([`PartialAnswers`]), which is a different thing entirely: the
//! interned, arena-backed rows the evaluator holds still stop here.
//!
//! The two halves of that sentence are refusals for two unrelated reasons, and neither
//! weakens the other. Rows stop here as a matter of **representation**: an evaluator row
//! carries [`SolutionTerm`](crate::SolutionTerm)s interned in a per-query scratch table
//! that dies with the evaluation context, so handing one out would be handing out a
//! dangling reference in all but name. [`FallibleSparqlError::Operational`] discards its
//! rows for a second, independent reason — **soundness**: a page that could not be read
//! bounds nothing, so the rows computed without it are neither a subset nor a superset of
//! the answer and there is no certificate to attach. A governed truncation is the case
//! where both objections lift at once: the rows are materialized out of the arena first,
//! and the engine chose to stop work it could have done, so what they bound is derivable.
