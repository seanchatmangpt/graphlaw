//! `CONSTRUCT` evaluation, emitting the IR dataset **directly** (no
//! serialize/re-parse round trip).
//!
//! The `WHERE` algebra is evaluated to a solution multiset; the template is then
//! instantiated once per solution into a fresh [`RdfDatasetBuilder`] and frozen.
//! Three SPARQL rules govern instantiation (§16.2):
//!
//! 1. A template triple with **any unbound variable** is silently skipped.
//! 2. A template **blank node is minted fresh per solution row** — the same label
//!    co-refers within one row but is a distinct node across rows.
//! 3. An **ill-formed** instantiation (a literal in subject position, or a non-IRI
//!    predicate) is skipped.
//!
//! Each position is instantiated to a [`TermValue`](purrdf_core::TermValue) first so its term *kind* can be
//! validated before interning into the output builder. Byte-identical parity with
//! the oxigraph baseline is decided downstream at the RDFC-1.0 canonicalization
//! layer, so blank-node labels and quad ordering here need not match oxigraph's —
//! `freeze` sorts and de-duplicates, and canonicalization relabels blanks.
