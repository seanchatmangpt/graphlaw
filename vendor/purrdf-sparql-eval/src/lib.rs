//! Native, RDF-1.2-first **multiset SPARQL evaluator** (purrdf S6).
//!
//! This crate is the evaluation runtime that consumes the
//! [`purrdf_sparql_algebra`] front-end (S5) and evaluates it over the
//! [`purrdf_core`] IR's [`DatasetView`](purrdf_core::DatasetView) read trait
//! **entirely in interned [`TermId`](purrdf_core::TermId) space**. It is the
//! native replacement for the oxigraph-family `spareval` on the query path and
//! the single required impl of the
//! [`SparqlEngine`](purrdf_core::SparqlEngine) seam.
//!
//! ## Design pillars
//!
//! - **TermId hot path.** Basic-graph-pattern matching and joins never leave
//!   interned-id space: constants resolve to a dataset
//!   [`purrdf_core::TermId`] once (via `term_id_by_value`, P4) and
//!   solutions carry [`SolutionTerm`]s that are a single integer compare apart.
//!   Computed terms (FILTER/BIND results not already in the dataset) are interned
//!   in a per-query scratch table — but a computed value that *does* exist in the
//!   dataset is **promoted** to [`SolutionTerm::Existing`] at mint time, so
//!   cross-case join keys are unequal purely by construction (no structural
//!   fallback at join time). See
//!   [`scratch`].
//! - **Multiset (bag) semantics.** Solutions are a bag, preserved until
//!   `DISTINCT`/`REDUCED`. See [`solution`].
//! - **Property paths in-engine (S8).** The `Path` graph pattern is evaluated
//!   over the same indexed surface, wasm-safe, covering the full algebra
//!   (`* + ? / | ^ !()` and the PurRDF `{n,m}` / `<any>` extensions) — see the
//!   `path` module.
//! - **Hard-fail, no degraded fallback.** `SERVICE` federation ([`remote`],
//!   [`remote_http`]), `LATERAL` (`binop`), host-injected **property-function**
//!   relations ([`property_fn`], `property_fn_plan`, `property_fn_eval`) and
//!   **custom aggregates** ([`agg_fn`], including the closed, ten-member
//!   first-party statistical set in [`stat_agg`] — `MEDIAN`/`PERCENTILE`/
//!   `STDDEV`/`VARIANCE`-family/`MODE`/`FIRST`/`LAST`/`TOPK`, reachable under a
//!   caller-supplied namespace via one
//!   [`agg_fn::AggregateRegistry::register_statistical_aggregates`] call), and
//!   SPARQL `UPDATE` ([`update`]) are all
//!   evaluated in-engine — none of them is out of scope. What remains a typed
//!   [`EvalError::Unsupported`] is a narrow, enumerated residue: a variable-bound
//!   quoted-triple-term component in a BGP or property-path pattern (`convert`), an
//!   unresolved custom SPARQL function IRI (`expr`), `heldIn` called without a
//!   caller-supplied standpoint-predicate configuration, and a manually constructed
//!   graph pattern whose nesting exceeds the parser's safety bound
//!   (`governor::soundness`). A call into a relation, or an `AGG(<iri>, …)` custom
//!   aggregate, the host did not register — or one no declared access pattern
//!   admits, for a relation — is not in that residue either: it is a typed
//!   [`EvalError::Function`], because the construct is supported and the host's
//!   table is what does not answer it. Never a wrong answer, and never a partial
//!   one *offered as complete* (the project `no-optionality` doctrine).
//! - **Governed execution, when a caller asks for it.** A caller may attach ceilings
//!   and a stop signal ([`governor::QueryGovernors`]) and run
//!   [`NativeSparqlEngine::query_governed`], which either completes or returns
//!   [`GovernedOutcome::BudgetExhausted`] — the rows already reached, plus a
//!   machine-checked [`PartialAnswers`] certificate saying whether they are a lower
//!   bound, an upper bound, or neither. This does not soften the pillar above; it is
//!   what lets the pillar stay absolute. A ceiling changes only the **outcome**, never
//!   the query's complete answer: different ceilings may expose different sides of that
//!   interval, but none labels an uncertified row as an answer. And a truncation is
//!   unrepresentable in the shape of a complete result — it is a distinct type, reachable
//!   only while carrying its certificate — so the engine still never hands anyone a
//!   partial answer they could mistake for the whole one. An ungoverned query takes the
//!   direct evaluator path before any governor charge, ledger, or stop probe. See
//!   [`governor`] and `docs/SPARQL-GOVERNOR-PROFILE.md`.
//!
//! The crate carries **zero oxigraph-family dependencies** and builds for
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (the wasm query path); both invariants are
//! gated by `make rdf-core-hygiene`.
