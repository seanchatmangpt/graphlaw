//! Existential Normal Form (ENF): the rewrite laws applied to every `EXISTS`/`NOT
//! EXISTS` inner pattern before either evaluation strategy — the memoized probe or
//! the per-row definition — runs over it.
//!
//! # The one-definition theorem
//!
//! `exists(X, μ)` has exactly one semantics:
//!
//! ```text
//! exists(X, μ) ⟺ eval(D(G), Replace(PrjMap(X), μ)) is non-empty
//! ```
//!
//! where `Replace` is Values Insertion at a `Bgp`/`Path`/`Graph(Var, ·)` site (join
//! the row in as a one-row `VALUES` table rather than a syntactic constant rewrite —
//! total over every RDF 1.2 term kind, including blank nodes and quoted triples,
//! because it reaches the dataset through the same evaluation path real `VALUES`
//! data uses) and `PrjMap` is realized by `Project`-boundary narrowing (μ is
//! restricted to a `Project` node's own variable list before it is injected below
//! that node — the one scope boundary the surface language has; see
//! [`crate::expr::SubstitutionRow::narrow_to`]).
//!
//! This engine carries exactly two IMPLEMENTATIONS of that one definition:
//!
//! 1. **The definition itself** — per-row substitution via
//!    [`crate::binop::eval_correlated`], which builds `Replace(PrjMap(X), μ)`
//!    explicitly for the current row and evaluates it. Always correct, for any `X`.
//! 2. **The memoized probe** — evaluate `X` exactly ONCE, unconstrained, build an
//!    index over the columns it shares with the outer schema, and existence-probe
//!    each row's μ against that index (`crate::binop::probe_has_match`). Correct
//!    ONLY where [`crate::governor::soundness::probe_admissible`] proves it
//!    equivalent to the definition for every μ the site can see.
//!
//! Both `crate::expr::eval_correlated` and `crate::governor::soundness`'s
//! probe-admissibility predicate cite this same theorem rather than restating it —
//! see their doc comments.
//!
//! # Records
//!
//! * **`toMultiSet` structural mootness.** SEP-0007 states `Replace` in terms of
//!   `toMultiSet(μ)`; this engine's algebra has no pattern/query type split for that
//!   conversion to bridge — a solution row already IS the multiset unit `Replace`
//!   joins in (a one-row `VALUES` table), so `Replace` lands directly below whatever
//!   modifiers wrap the leaf it targets, with nothing extra to construct.
//! * **The `HAVING` position.** A current-row variable appearing in a `HAVING`
//!   clause of an `EXISTS`'s inner sub-`SELECT` is OUTSIDE SEP-0007's stated
//!   coverage (SEP-0007 only specifies `Replace` for `Bgp`/`Path`/`Graph`
//!   Values-Insertion sites and ordinary expression positions). PurRDF follows the
//!   literal `PrjMap` reading: a sub-`SELECT`'s `HAVING` filters that sub-`SELECT`'s
//!   OWN scope only, exactly like every other expression inside it — no special
//!   correlation channel is invented for it beyond what `Replace`/`PrjMap` already
//!   provide.
//! * **Governed truncation.** A governor-truncated inner bag is never a sound
//!   answer to `exists(X, μ)` in either direction (see
//!   [`crate::governor::soundness`]'s module doc on why `EXISTS` is classified
//!   [`crate::governor::soundness::ChildRole::Opaque`]): both evaluation strategies
//!   refuse to memoize or answer from a truncated inner, recording the trip on the
//!   expression barrier instead — see [`crate::expr::exists`]'s doc.
//! * **Truncated-at-one-witness is complete for emptiness.** The definition path's
//!   first-witness wrap (below) truncates the inner's row COUNT but never its
//!   EMPTINESS: "does this bag have a first row" is exactly what `Slice{0, Some(1)}`
//!   answers completely, even though the bag's full contents are not computed. This
//!   is unrelated to — and not weakened by — the governed-truncation refusal above,
//!   which is about a governor cutting evaluation short of even that first witness
//!   under an exhausted budget, a distinct (and distinctly refused) condition.
//! * **The SHACL pre-binding fork.** `crate::substitute::apply_shacl_prebinding`
//!   (`substitute_pattern_impl` in that module — not this crate's
//!   `crate::expr::substitute_pattern_impl`, a different, unrelated walk with a
//!   coincidentally similar name) deliberately diverges from THIS module's
//!   `Replace`/Values-Insertion walk in three ways, none of them an oversight:
//!   1. **No `Project`-boundary narrowing.** A SHACL `$this` (or another
//!      pre-bound variable) must reach an UNPROJECTED scope inside a nested
//!      sub-`SELECT` — the shapes language's focus-node binding is not subject to
//!      SPARQL's own scope rule the way an `EXISTS` correlation is, so
//!      `apply_shacl_prebinding` rewrites `Expression::Variable`/`Expression::Bound`
//!      unconditionally through every nested pattern, `Project` included.
//!   2. **Single query-level injection, not per-row.** A pre-binding substitutes
//!      ONE caller-supplied value into the whole query ONCE, before any row is
//!      evaluated — there is no "current row" to restrict against, unlike
//!      `Replace`, which runs once per outer row inside a live evaluation.
//!   3. **Literal property-function-argument substitution.** SHACL pre-binding
//!      rewrites a `PropertyFunction` argument's `TermPattern` directly (an
//!      IRI/literal constant swap), where `Replace`'s Values-Insertion walk never
//!      touches `PropertyFunction` argument vectors at all — a relation's argument
//!      is an invocation input the evaluator reads from the row, not a join key a
//!      `VALUES` table can supply (see `crate::expr::substitute_term_pattern`'s
//!      doc).
//!
//! # Existential Normal Form itself (Part A)
//!
//! Exactly one bit per row is observed under [`Expression::Exists`][exists]: whether
//! the inner pattern's evaluation is empty. Four rewrite laws exploit that: each
//! replaces a node with something PROVABLY EMPTINESS-EQUIVALENT but cheaper (or, for
//! law 4b, decides the answer outright without evaluating anything). They apply
//! along the **emptiness-observed spine** — the chain from the inner's own root
//! through every [`GraphPattern::OrderBy`]/[`GraphPattern::Distinct`]/
//! [`GraphPattern::Reduced`]/an identity-or-length-preserving
//! [`GraphPattern::Slice`]/[`GraphPattern::Project`] wrapper, and into BOTH branches
//! of a [`GraphPattern::Union`] (a union is empty iff both branches are) — and
//! **never** through a [`GraphPattern::Join`]/[`GraphPattern::Filter`]/
//! [`GraphPattern::Extend`]/[`GraphPattern::Graph`]/[`GraphPattern::Minus`]/
//! [`GraphPattern::LeftJoin`] operand: those consume a ROW SET (their own semantics
//! read more than "is it empty" from their child), so rewriting past them would
//! change what THEY compute, not merely how emptiness is decided.
//!
//! [exists]: purrdf_sparql_algebra::Expression::Exists
//!
//! ## Side conditions: a law may erase only an EFFECT-FREE portion
//!
//! Every law above is proved emptiness-equivalent over ROW SETS — it says what the
//! erased portion's presence or absence does to the row COUNT, never what evaluating
//! it might otherwise have done. A hard [`EvalError`](crate::EvalError) (an
//! unresolved custom function, an unconfigured `heldIn`, a malformed `rdf:List`, an
//! unresolved property-function relation or a mis-invoked one) or an observable
//! remote effect (a `SERVICE` call, `SILENT` or not) raised while evaluating the
//! erased portion would propagate outside the `EXISTS` if that portion sat OUTSIDE
//! one — so erasing it unconditionally would make the same query shape silently
//! swallow the error/effect merely for having been written inside an `EXISTS`. Each
//! law below is therefore additionally gated on
//! [`crate::governor::soundness::NodeAnalysis::can_hard_error`] being `false` for
//! the portion it erases; a law whose gate does not hold simply does not fire, and
//! the un-erased pattern falls through to the definition/probe machinery, which
//! evaluates it and lets the error/effect propagate exactly as it would outside an
//! `EXISTS`. A law that erases nothing evaluable (3, 4a) needs no gate at all.
//!
//! ## Law 1 — `LeftJoin(A, B, c) → A` on the spine
//!
//! **THE F2 FIX BY LAW.** An `OPTIONAL` (`LeftJoin`) emits AT LEAST ONE row per left
//! row, for every left row, unconditionally: either the padded left row alone (no
//! compatible right row, or the join condition rejected every candidate) or one row
//! per compatible match. It never REMOVES a left row. So `LeftJoin(A, B, c)` is empty
//! **iff** `A` is empty, regardless of `B` or `c` — the whole right side and its join
//! condition are irrelevant to the one bit `EXISTS` reads. Replacing the node with
//! `A` alone preserves emptiness for every μ and drops the correlation `B`/`c` may
//! carry — the shape a bare `OPTIONAL` at the top of an `EXISTS` inner has always
//! (wrongly) been treated as correlated by, before this law existed.
//!
//! **Side condition**: fires only when BOTH `B` and `c` are effect-free (see "Side
//! conditions" above) — erasing either could otherwise erase a hard error or a
//! `SERVICE` effect it would have raised.
//!
//! ## Law 2 — `OrderBy(P) → P` on the spine
//!
//! Sorting is a permutation, never a filter: `OrderBy(P)` and `P` have the same
//! multiset of rows, so they are empty under exactly the same condition. The sort
//! keys are never evaluated at all once emptiness is the only question asked.
//!
//! **Side condition**: fires only when every sort key expression is effect-free —
//! "never evaluated at all" is exactly the erasure this module's laws must not
//! perform on a key that could otherwise have hard-failed.
//!
//! ## Law 3 — `Distinct(P) → P`, `Reduced(P) → P` on the spine (no `Slice(start>0)` above)
//!
//! De-duplication (`DISTINCT`) and its permissive cousin (`REDUCED`) can only ever
//! REMOVE rows relative to `P`, never add one — and they remove a row only when an
//! EARLIER-appearing row already carries the same value, so `P` empty implies
//! `Distinct(P)`/`Reduced(P)` empty and conversely `P` non-empty always leaves at
//! least the first row's value present after dedup. The two are therefore
//! empty under exactly the same condition as `P`.
//!
//! **Side condition**: none — unconditional. Only the dedup wrapper is erased; `P`
//! itself is still evaluated by whatever [`normalize`] returns, so nothing
//! evaluable is ever discarded.
//!
//! The "no `Slice(start>0)` above" qualifier in the source rule is automatically
//! satisfied by this law's own scope: a restricting-offset `Slice` is not one of the
//! spine's transparent wrappers (law 4 handles only `start == 0`), so the top-down
//! walk below never descends PAST one to reach a `Distinct`/`Reduced` in the first
//! place — there is no separate flag to thread.
//!
//! ## Law 4 — `Slice` on the spine
//!
//! * **4a**: `Slice(0, len ≥ 1)(P) → P`. An offset-zero slice with room for at least
//!   one row drops rows only from the END of `P`'s bag (past the first `len`), never
//!   the front, so `P` non-empty always leaves row zero inside the slice's window —
//!   the slice is empty exactly when `P` is. **Side condition**: none — unconditional,
//!   for the same reason as law 3: only the `Slice` wrapper is erased, and `P` is
//!   still evaluated by whatever [`normalize`] returns.
//! * **4b**: `Slice(_, Some(0))(P) → ⊥` (the whole `EXISTS` folds to constant
//!   `false`). A zero-length slice is empty FOR EVERY `P` and EVERY μ — it needs no
//!   evaluation at all, so the fold is represented directly: [`normalize`] returns
//!   [`Enf::FoldedEmpty`] rather than a pattern to evaluate, and
//!   [`crate::expr::exists`] answers `false` (making `NOT EXISTS`, `Not(Exists(..))`
//!   in this algebra, answer `true`) without touching the dataset. **Side
//!   condition**: fires only when the WHOLE of `P` is effect-free — the fold
//!   suppresses every evaluation `P` would otherwise have performed, so an effectful
//!   `P` must fall through and actually be evaluated instead of being folded away.
//!
//! A `Slice(start > 0, _)` is NOT one of the transparent wrappers: an offset can
//! discard every row `P` produces (when `P`'s bag is shorter than `start`) even
//! though `P` itself is non-empty, so slicing past an offset is not
//! emptiness-equivalent to `P` and the walk stops there, keeping the `Slice` node
//! as-is.
//!
//! ## Fixpoint, determinism, idempotence
//!
//! [`normalize`] recurses on every law that erases a wrapper, so a chain of several
//! spine wrappers (e.g. `OrderBy(Distinct(LeftJoin(A, B, c)))`) collapses in one call
//! to `A` (further normalized itself, in case `A` is ALSO spine-shaped). The walk is
//! a pure function of the input tree — no clock, no RNG, no iteration-order
//! dependence — so it is deterministic and, applied to its own output, a no-op
//! (idempotent): a normalized tree exposes no further spine wrapper for the walk to
//! erase.
//!
//! # Prepare-seam choice
//!
//! [`normalize`] is invoked lazily, the first time each distinct `EXISTS`/`NOT
//! EXISTS` AST node is reached during an evaluation, and its result is cached for
//! the remainder of that evaluation (`crate::eval::EvalCtx`'s per-query cache
//! discipline, exactly like `exists_inner_cache`'s lifecycle) — NOT at
//! [`crate::engine::PlanCache`] construction, even though that IS a genuine
//! prepare-time seam for the common case (parsed query text reaching evaluation
//! through [`crate::engine::NativeSparqlEngine::query`] and its siblings). The
//! reason: `PlanCache` is only ONE of several ways a [`GraphPattern`] reaches
//! evaluation in this crate. SHACL-SPARQL pre-binding, the entailment chase's
//! rewritten plans, `LATERAL`'s and `EXISTS`'s own per-row substituted temporaries,
//! and the majority of this crate's unit tests all construct or receive a
//! [`purrdf_sparql_algebra::Query`]/[`GraphPattern`] directly, bypassing
//! `PlanCache` entirely. Gating normalization at `PlanCache` construction would
//! silently leave every one of those paths evaluating un-normalized algebra,
//! reintroducing exactly the two-tier inconsistency (some `EXISTS` sites
//! defensible, some not) this task exists to eliminate. Hooking at first-encounter
//! with a per-query cache guarantees uniform coverage on every path while staying
//! "prepare-time" in the sense that matters operationally: computed once per
//! distinct site per evaluation, before any row of that site is tested, never
//! recomputed per row.
