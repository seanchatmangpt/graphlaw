//! Binary graph-pattern operators: `Join` and `Union` (multiset semantics).
//!
//! Both produce a result over the **ordered union** of the operand schemas (left
//! columns first), and both preserve multiset cardinality — duplicate solutions
//! are kept (no implicit `DISTINCT`).
//!
//! `Join` is a hash join on the shared variables. The wrinkle is **unbound shared
//! columns**: a solution may leave a shared variable unbound (`None`), which is
//! compatible with any value (SPARQL §17.5 / §18.2.2). A pure hash-on-key join is
//! correct only when every shared column is bound, so the build side is split into
//! a key-indexed set (all shared columns bound) and a `wild` list (≥1 shared column
//! unbound), and a probe row that itself has an unbound shared column falls back to
//! a compatibility scan over all build rows. The common case — two fully-bound BGPs
//! — stays an O(n+m) hash join.

    // A branch `{ FILTER(expr) }` is `Filter { expr, inner: <empty BGP> }` over the
    // unit solution (one row, empty schema). Per SPARQL 1.1:
    //   * `{ FILTER(true) }` keeps that unit solution — one empty binding — which,
    //     after the enclosing join, joins with EVERY outer row (its unbound shared
    //     column matches anything).
    //   * `{ FILTER(?a > 0) }` sees ?a UNBOUND inside that group (it has no BGP that
    //     binds ?a), so `?a > 0` is a type error ⇒ EBV false ⇒ the branch yields ZERO
    //     rows. The whole query must NOT collapse to empty — only the OTHER UNION
    //     branch contributes.
    // These two shapes have DIFFERENT correct results; the tests encode the split.
