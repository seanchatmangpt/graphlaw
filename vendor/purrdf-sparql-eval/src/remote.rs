//! SPARQL `SERVICE` federation: the `eval_service` handler and the
//! [`ServiceResolver`] seam.
//!
//! `SERVICE [SILENT] <endpoint> { pattern }` evaluates `pattern` at a remote
//! endpoint and joins the result into the surrounding query. The evaluator stays
//! transport-agnostic: it forwards the inner pattern (serialized to a `SELECT *`
//! query via [`purrdf_sparql_algebra::pattern_to_select_query`]) to an injected
//! [`ServiceResolver`] and interns the returned bindings into a
//! [`SolutionSeq`]. The parser wraps `SERVICE` in `Join(left, Service)`, so
//! `eval_service` returns *only* the remote bag — the existing hash join performs
//! the federation join.
//!
//! # Seam, not a baked client
//!
//! [`ServiceResolver`] is the dependency-inversion seam:
//! [`crate::remote_http::HttpRemoteQuerySource`] builds/decodes SPARQL Protocol
//! requests through a caller-supplied HTTP transport, and
//! [`InProcessServiceResolver`](crate::service::InProcessServiceResolver) dog-foods the
//! local engine in memory. This keeps the core query path wasm-clean and makes `SERVICE`
//! deterministically testable offline.
//!
//! It takes the whole request as one [`ServiceRequest`] value, which is what gives
//! per-service context — headers, credentials, capabilities — somewhere to live other
//! than the service IRI. That context and the policy over it are in [`crate::service`].
//!
//! # Hard-fail vs SILENT
//!
//! With no source configured, a variable endpoint, a transport error, or an
//! undecodable response: a **non-silent** `SERVICE` raises [`EvalError::Remote`]
//! (the query aborts), while `SERVICE SILENT` swallows the failure to the join
//! identity (one empty row) so the surrounding query proceeds unchanged.
//!
//! A [`RemoteError::Denied`] is the exception, and belongs with the governors below
//! rather than with the endpoint failures above: it is a refusal decided on *this* side
//! of the seam, so `SILENT` never swallows it — at any nesting depth, which is why it
//! travels as the structured [`EvalError::ServiceDenied`] rather than as message text.
//! See [`crate::service`] for the full contract table.
//!
//! # `SILENT` is about the endpoint, never about this engine's budget
//!
//! `SILENT` says "a federated endpoint I do not control may be unreachable, and I would
//! rather have the rest of my answer than an error". It says nothing about the caller's
//! own governors, so a governor trip reached through a `SERVICE` clause is
//! **non-silenceable**: it propagates as a truncation whether or not `SILENT` is present
//! (see [`RemoteError::Governed`]). Swallowing a trip to the join identity would leave the
//! surrounding join a no-op and the final result indistinguishable from a complete one —
//! an answer that looks complete and is wrong, which is worse than either an error or an
//! honest partial.
//!
//! # A federated call is governed at both ends
//!
//! The seam takes the execution's [`StopSignal`], and it is polled **before** dispatch, so
//! an expired deadline prevents the request rather than observing it after the network
//! call has already gone out. The signal is also handed to the source itself, so a host
//! transport can consult it while this evaluator is blocked inside the call — the one
//! window in which nothing else can. Both the request and every ingested row are charged,
//! and the response is measured against the intermediate-cell ceiling before a single row
//! of it is interned, so a response arriving from outside the dataset cannot walk past
//! ceilings that bound everything computed inside it.
