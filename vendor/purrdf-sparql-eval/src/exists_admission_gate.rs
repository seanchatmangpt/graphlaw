//! The differential machinery that proves the `EXISTS` admission boundary
//! (`crate::governor::soundness::probe_admissible`) is non-vacuous — every
//! ADMISSIBLE shape genuinely agrees with the per-row definition, and every
//! INADMISSIBLE one genuinely, observably diverges from it when forced through
//! the probe anyway.
//!
//! # The seam
//!
//! [`crate::expr::force_exists_strategy_for_test`] is a `#[cfg(test)]` thread-local
//! override (the same idiom [`crate::parallel::force_parallel_for_test`] already
//! uses for its own measurement seam) that pins [`crate::expr::exists`]'s
//! probe-vs-definition decision to a specific [`crate::expr::ForcedExistsStrategy`],
//! bypassing `probe_admissible` entirely in EITHER direction:
//!
//! * `Definition` on a shape the gate would ADMIT — always sound (the definition is
//!   correct for every shape), used below to prove the two strategies AGREE on every
//!   admissible arm.
//! * `Probe` on a shape the gate would REFUSE — unsound by construction where the
//!   arm's exclusion is load-bearing, used below to observe (and pin) the SPECIFIC
//!   wrong answer the gate exists to prevent.
//!
//! The seam is entirely `#[cfg(test)]`-gated (the thread-local, the enum, the guard,
//! and the one `if let` read at the decision site) — see `crate::expr`'s definitions.
//! It is never constructible outside this crate's own test binary, and does not exist
//! at all in a non-test build (verified by `make wasm`/hygiene: a `cfg(test)`-gated
//! item contributes nothing to a release artifact).
//!
//! # Organization
//!
//! * **Admissible-arm equivalence** (`exists_paths_agree_on_*`) — one test per arm
//!   `probe_admissible` admits, each a correlated shape whose family IS that arm, on a
//!   fixture where the natural (memoized-probe) answer and the forced-definition
//!   answer are compared row-for-row, with the fixture chosen so the answer is
//!   non-trivial (some outer rows true, some false).
//! * **Divergence witnesses** (`probe_would_*`) — one test per arm `probe_admissible`
//!   REFUSES, each forcing the probe onto that exact shape and asserting the SPECIFIC
//!   wrong answer against the correct (definition-path) one.
//! * **Parity cases** — error discipline and `SERVICE SILENT` swallow-point symmetry
//!   across strategies, plus the stateful-builtin classification pin.
//! * **The bounded-exhaustive generator** — enumerates `EXISTS` inner shapes from a
//!   small algebra grammar to a bounded depth (modeled on
//!   `crate::parallel_determinism_gate`'s corpus-gate architecture, but generated
//!   rather than hand-written) and checks memo-on ≡ memo-off everywhere, and
//!   probe ≡ forced-definition wherever the gate admits.
//! * **Governed × strategy** — the truncated-inner-never-memoized discipline, pinned
//!   against the current (post-redesign) decision site.
