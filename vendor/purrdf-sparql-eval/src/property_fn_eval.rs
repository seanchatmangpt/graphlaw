//! The property-function **dispatch**: evaluating a
//! [`GraphPattern::PropertyFunction`] node against the injected registry.
//!
//! A call is a row source driven **per input row**. The rows it is driven over come
//! from the enclosing `Lateral` — the shape the parser builds for a triples block
//! containing a call — and the call's arguments are read DIRECTLY from that row:
//!
//! ```text
//! ?doc ex:contains ("needle" ?score)
//! ```
//!
//! with `?doc` bound by a sibling data pattern is one invocation per document, each
//! with the document and the needle BOUND and only `?score` free.
//!
//! # Why the arguments are read from the row rather than from a substituted node
//!
//! The generic `Lateral` path substitutes the outer row into its right operand and
//! evaluates the rewritten pattern. That substitution is IRI-only by doctrine
//! ([`crate::expr::substitute_pattern`]): a literal, blank-node or quoted-triple
//! binding stays a variable in the rewritten tree and is reconciled afterwards by the
//! lateral join's compatibility test. For an ordinary pattern that is merely a
//! late filter. For a relation it would be a **wrong access pattern**: the position
//! would be reported free, the invocation's [`BindingPattern`] would lose a bound bit,
//! and a relation that declares only `bf` would be refused an invocation the engine
//! can perfectly well make — or, worse, an unbounded generator would be opened
//! wide-open and filtered afterwards. So the call reads the row itself and every
//! binding, whatever its term kind, becomes a bound argument.
//!
//! # What the engine guarantees about what a relation returns
//!
//! A relation is arbitrary host Rust, so nothing it emits is trusted:
//!
//! * **Row width** is checked against the declared arity before a row is used.
//! * **Bound positions are equality-filtered.** A relation may echo the input value
//!   (the usual thing) or emit any candidate it likes; a row disagreeing at a bound
//!   position is dropped. This is what makes `PropertyFunction::admits`'s subsumption
//!   rule sound — a relation serving `bf` answers a `bb` invocation by generating and
//!   letting this filter cut.
//! * **Repeated variables** — within one side or across both — are enforced by the
//!   same mechanism: the first occurrence binds, later occurrences compare. A row
//!   violating consistency is FILTERED, not an error: it is an ordinary non-match,
//!   exactly as `?s ex:p ?s` is for a triple pattern.
//! * **Blank-node arguments** are non-distinguished variables: they bind, they enforce
//!   consistency across their occurrences within the call, and they are projected away
//!   before the node's rows leave — the same treatment `crate::bgp` gives a blank in a
//!   triple pattern, using the same synthetic-slot machinery.
//!
//! # Where a call's row ceiling comes from
//!
//! A call stops producing once the node whose output its rows are can use no more of
//! them — the answer-cap / `LIMIT` pushdown's verdict. Which node that is depends on the
//! shape, and the two are genuinely different nodes:
//!
//! * A call written with nothing before it in its group is a plan node evaluated at its
//!   own address, and the ceiling recorded there is its own.
//! * A call written after a data pattern is the right operand of a `Lateral`, and
//!   [`crate::binop::eval_lateral`] FUSES the pair: the rows produced below are already
//!   joined with the left row, so they are the `Lateral`'s output rows and the ceiling
//!   that bounds them is the `Lateral`'s. That node's certificate is what licensed it;
//!   nothing new is licensed by the fusion, and the call node itself carries no ceiling
//!   (see [`crate::governor::soundness::child_row_ceiling`]).
//!
//! The ceiling is consumed twice over: this dispatch stops accumulating at it, and — for
//! a call whose positions leave the engine nothing to filter — it is passed on to the
//! relation as the licence to stop generating. The intermediate-cell ceiling is a
//! separate, live governor and is applied to the same bag through the shared
//! [`crate::row_ingest::GovernedRowIngest`], exactly as `crate::bgp` applies both to a
//! join order's last stage.
//!
//! # Emission order is preserved verbatim
//!
//! Rows leave in the order the relation emitted them, per input row in input-row
//! order. Nothing is sorted, and nothing is de-duplicated: a relation's declared
//! emission order is part of its contract precisely so the query's answer is
//! reproducible, and re-ordering it here would throw that away.
