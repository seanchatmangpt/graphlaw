//! Host-injected **property functions** — relations invoked from predicate position.
//!
//! A predicate IRI under a caller-configured
//! [`ParserOptions::property_fn_namespaces`](purrdf_sparql_algebra::ParserOptions)
//! (prefix match), or one that exactly matches an entry of
//! [`ParserOptions::property_fn_iris`](purrdf_sparql_algebra::ParserOptions) — the
//! set [`NativeSparqlEngine`](crate::NativeSparqlEngine) derives one-to-one from
//! this registry's keys, so a registered relation is reachable without also
//! reclassifying every other IRI under its namespace — is lowered by the parser to
//! [`purrdf_sparql_algebra::GraphPattern::PropertyFunction`]
//! instead of an ordinary triple pattern, and resolved at evaluation time against a
//! caller-injected [`PropertyFunctionRegistry`]. Where [`crate::user_fn`] injects
//! *functions* — one value per call, in an expression position — this module injects
//! *relations*: a call is a row source in a graph-pattern position, and it may emit
//! zero, one, or many rows per invocation.
//!
//! # Why a relation is not a function with extra steps
//!
//! Three properties follow from being a row source rather than a value, and each one
//! shows up as a distinct piece of this module's contract:
//!
//! * **Access patterns.** A relation is rarely computable in every direction. A
//!   `split(?whole, ?part)` relation can enumerate parts from a whole but not wholes
//!   from a part. So a relation *declares* the argument-binding patterns it can serve
//!   ([`PropertyFunction::modes`]), and an invocation is admitted only when one of
//!   them is general enough to cover it ([`PropertyFunction::admits`]).
//! * **Cardinality.** A call can be an unbounded generator, so the planner needs a
//!   declared upper bound per access pattern ([`PropertyFunction::rows_per_invocation`])
//!   to order calls and to admit them against a ceiling.
//! * **Emission order.** A bag of rows has an order, and SPARQL results are
//!   reproducible only if that order is. So the order a relation emits in is part of
//!   its contract, and the engine preserves it.
//!
//! # The trust boundary
//!
//! A relation is arbitrary host Rust. Every invariant the evaluator needs from it is
//! therefore either **checked before host code runs** (arity, in
//! [`open_contained`]), **contained when host code misbehaves** (a panic, in
//! [`open_contained`]/[`next_contained`] for `open`/`next`, and in
//! [`declaration_contained`] for `arity`/`modes`/`volatility`/`rows_per_invocation` —
//! every one of the four is host code exactly as `open`/`next` is, so nothing reads one
//! directly), or **applied to what host code returns** (equality on bound positions, and
//! the row-width check, in the dispatch). A relation that ignores its own declarations
//! cannot make the engine unsound; it can only make it slow, or make its own call fail.
//!
//! The row ceiling [`PropertyFunction::open`] receives is the one place that asks a
//! relation for cooperation rather than checking it, because "I stopped early" and "I
//! am exhausted" are the same empty cursor and no engine-side measure can tell them
//! apart. The obligation is kept as small as the seam allows: the ceiling counts rows
//! the relation emits that agree with the bound values it was handed — everything the
//! engine filters on that the relation cannot see makes the engine withhold the ceiling
//! instead (see [`PropertyFunction`]'s ceiling contract).

/// A host-injected relation invoked from predicate position.
///
/// Object-safe and shared behind an [`Arc`] across the whole evaluation (including
/// fork-join workers), hence `Send + Sync`. It works entirely in dataset-independent
/// [`TermValue`] space: a relation never sees a dataset-local
/// [`TermId`](purrdf_core::TermId), so a registry built once is valid against any
/// dataset.
///
/// # Feasibility: which invocations a relation can serve
///
/// [`modes`](Self::modes) declares the access patterns the relation can compute,
/// over the flattened positions [`PfArity`] documents. An invocation whose own
/// pattern is `p` is **feasible** iff some declared mode `m` satisfies
/// `m.subsumes(p)` — that is, `bound(m) ⊆ bound(p)`, the subsumption order
/// [`BindingPattern`] defines.
///
/// The subset direction is the useful one: a relation that can serve `fb` (object
/// bound, subject free) can also serve `bb`, by producing the `fb` rows and letting
/// the engine's equality filter on the now-bound subject position discard the
/// mismatches — generate-then-filter. The converse does not hold, which is why a
/// relation that declares only `bf` genuinely cannot answer an `ff` invocation. A
/// relation that can serve everything declares exactly one mode, the all-free
/// [`PfArity::all_free_mode`], which subsumes every pattern of its arity.
///
/// # The ceiling is a licence, not a contract
///
/// [`open`](Self::open) receives the row ceiling the engine's answer-cap pushdown
/// computed for the node this invocation's rows belong to, when it has one — a `LIMIT`
/// or an answer cap, arrived at through the plan's soundness certificate. It is
/// permission to stop early, so that a generator (a text index, a nearest-neighbour
/// search) can bound its own work instead of producing rows nobody will read. The
/// engine stops consuming at its own ceiling regardless, so a relation that ignores the
/// argument entirely is correct, merely less efficient.
///
/// A relation that *does* use it counts **rows it emits that agree with the bound
/// positions it was handed**. That distinction is the whole of the obligation, and it
/// exists because a relation is entitled to generate candidates and let the engine's
/// equality filter cut them (see [`PfRow`]): candidates the relation itself can see are
/// doomed must not be counted against the licence, or a stop at `k` would hand back
/// fewer than `k` usable rows and the engine would read the short bag as an exhausted
/// one. Everything the engine filters on that a relation could *not* see — a repeated
/// variable across two free positions, a partially-bound quoted triple — is handled on

/// other relation is measured against — and it is directly useful: a host with a
/// small extensional table (a code list, a unit-conversion table, a fixture in a
/// test) can expose it to SPARQL without writing an evaluator.
///
/// * **Every mode is served.** It declares exactly one mode, the all-free
///   [`PfArity::all_free_mode`], which subsumes every access pattern of its arity —
///   so any invocation is feasible. Bound positions are applied as per-position term
///   equality during the scan; the engine's own equality filter on bound positions
///   then has nothing left to remove.
/// * **Order is insertion order.** Rows are emitted in the order they were supplied,
///   filtered but never reordered.
/// * **The row ceiling is honoured.** Given a ceiling, the cursor stops after emitting
///   that many rows — counting the rows it emits, not the rows it skips, which is the
///   accounting the licence requires (see [`PropertyFunction`]'s ceiling contract).
///   Because the emitted rows are the first ones the unbounded scan would have produced,
///   the answer is the same one, computed over less of the table.
/// * **The row bound is exact.** [`PropertyFunction::rows_per_invocation`] reports the
///   table's row count, which no invocation can exceed.
/// * **It is [`Volatility::Stable`]**: a frozen table is deterministic for the
///   lifetime of a query, so it may run across fork-join workers.
