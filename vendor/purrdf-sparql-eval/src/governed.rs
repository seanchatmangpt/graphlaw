//! The public outcome of a **governed** query: a complete result, or an exhausted budget
//! carrying the partial answers the execution actually reached.
//!
//! # Two outcomes, one of which is not an error
//!
//! A governor trip is neither a complete result nor a failure. Conflating it with either
//! is the failure mode this module exists to make unrepresentable: reported as complete, a
//! truncated answer is silently wrong; reported as an error, the rows the budget already
//! paid for are thrown away and the caller is told the engine misbehaved. So
//! [`GovernedOutcome`] has exactly two shapes, and the second one carries both the
//! [`TrippedGovernor`] that stopped the execution and what the rows in hand bound.
//!
//! # Everything here is materialized and non-generic
//!
//! The evaluator's internal partial-result channel is generic over the dataset's id type
//! and carries interned solution terms — including terms minted into the per-query scratch
//! arena, which dies with the evaluation context. Those cannot cross a public boundary:
//! a scratch id outside its own execution is a dangling reference in all but name. So the
//! rows are materialized into the ordinary [`SparqlResult`] egress model — the same
//! model a complete query returns — **before** they reach any type in this module, exactly
//! as the engine already does for a complete result.
//!
//! # What a partial answer is allowed to claim
//!
//! Never "these are the answers". [`PartialAnswers`] states one of the three things the
//! evaluator's prefix-monotonicity certificate can prove, and no more: a lower bound (safe
//! to admit as answers), an upper bound (safe only for "definitely not an answer"), or
//! neither — in which case no row crosses at all and the caller receives the
//! [`NonMonotoneBarrier`] naming the operator that withheld them instead.
//!
//! # UPDATE has its own outcome, and it has no partial arm
//!
//! [`GovernedUpdateOutcome`] is deliberately *not* [`GovernedOutcome`]. A query's partial
//! answer is a useful, certifiable thing; a partial *mutation* is not a thing at all. See
//! that type for the argument.

/// certifiable "partial mutation", because the thing a partial answer certifies (a bound
/// on a set of rows) has no counterpart in a store that a caller will go on to read as if
/// it were whole. An `INSERT`/`DELETE` that landed halfway and was reported as "budget
/// exhausted" is not an incomplete result; it is a corrupt store, and the corruption is
/// silent — every later query answers confidently from it.
///
/// So the trip arm below carries the governor and the evidence and **structurally nothing
/// else**: there is no field a caller could read partial mutations out of, because the
/// engine guarantees there are none to read. A tripped request leaves the caller's dataset
/// handle exactly as it found it — the same `Arc`, not merely an equal one.
///
/// # The vocabulary is shared with the query path
///
/// [`TrippedGovernor`] and [`GovernorEvidence`] are the same kernel types
