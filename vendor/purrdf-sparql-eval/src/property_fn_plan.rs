//! **Prepare-time feasibility ordering** for property-function calls: the rewrite that
//! turns a group's textual order into one the registered relations can actually serve.
//!
//! A relation is rarely computable in every direction (see
//! [`crate::property_fn`]). `split(?whole, ?part)` enumerates parts from a whole and
//! not the reverse; a full-text relation wants its needle bound. So the order a query
//! author writes is not necessarily an order the engine can run:
//!
//! ```text
//! { ?doc ex:contains ("needle" ?score) . ?doc ex:section ex:intro }
//! ```
//!
//! reads left to right as "invoke the relation with everything free, then filter", and
//! for an `fb`-only relation that is not merely slow — it is infeasible. Ordering the
//! data pattern first makes `?doc` bound and the call `bf`.
//!
//! # What this pass is, and is deliberately not
//!
//! It is **statistics-free and deterministic**. It reads only the algebra and the
//! registry's declarations — never the dataset, never a cardinality estimate — so the
//! order a query gets is a pure function of its text and the host's configuration, and
//! two runs of the same query against different data plan identically. It is not a
//! cost-based join planner: `crate::bgp` already reorders triple patterns inside a BGP
//! using real cardinalities, and this pass never reaches inside one.
//!
//! # Where it runs, and why there
//!
//! At **prepare** time, on the parsed algebra, before evaluation begins — so the
//! admission failures below (an unregistered IRI, an arity mismatch, an order no
//! relation can serve) are raised before a governed execution has spent a single unit
//! of its budget on a query that could never have run. A caller's ceiling is for the
//! work its query does, not for discovering that the query is misconfigured.

/// A deterministic fingerprint of everything about `relations` that can change either

/// by every registered IRI's arity, its declared volatility, and its declared modes with
/// their row bounds, IRI-sorted.
///
/// # The instance id comes first, and is load-bearing
///
/// Declared metadata alone cannot tell two registries apart when they happen to agree on
/// every declaration for a shared IRI while resolving it to two DIFFERENT
/// [`PropertyFunction`](crate::property_fn::PropertyFunction) implementations — two
/// relations can declare the identical arity, volatility, and modes while returning
/// entirely different rows. The [`RegistryId`](crate::registry_id::RegistryId) each
/// registry mints at construction ([`PropertyFunctionRegistry::instance_id`]) closes
/// that hole: two registries can never share a fingerprint unless they are the SAME
/// instance (or a [`Clone`] of it, which shares the identical
/// `Arc<dyn PropertyFunction>` implementations — see that type's docs), regardless of
/// how identical their declarations read.
///
/// This belongs in the plan cache's key. The rewrite above is a function of the query
/// text AND the registry's declarations, so two differently-configured — or merely
/// differently CONSTRUCTED — registries can order the same text differently, and a cache
/// keyed on the text alone would hand the second host the first host's plan. Volatility
/// belongs here for a reason the ORDERING pass never sees: it is not read while
/// planning, but it IS read at evaluation time to decide whether a call may run on a
/// fork-join worker (see [`Volatility`](crate::user_fn::Volatility)), so two registries
/// that agree on every arity and mode but disagree about which relation is stable must
/// still be treated as two distinct configurations — sharing a cache entry between them
/// would be silent only until one relation actually depended on sequential evaluation.
///
/// Derived from [`PropertyFunctionRegistry::describe`], which is already IRI-sorted, so
/// the content half of the fingerprint is a pure function of the registry's contents
/// rather than of its construction order (the instance id half is, by construction, a
/// pure function of WHICH construction). Also the identity a governed receipt carries
/// (see `RelationIdentity` in `crate::governed`) — the same reason it belongs in the
/// cache key applies to the receipt: two registries that produce different fingerprints
/// can produce different answers, so a receipt that cannot tell them apart is not a
/// receipt.

/// [`PropertyFunctionRegistry::describe`]'s own failure, propagated unchanged. Never
/// raised when `relations` is empty (which [`PropertyFunctionRegistry::EMPTY`] — the
