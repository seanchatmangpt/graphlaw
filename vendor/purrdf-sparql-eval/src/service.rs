//! Per-service context for the `SERVICE` seam: [`ServiceCatalog`], [`ServiceProfile`],
//! [`ServiceCapabilities`], [`ServiceCredential`], and the two resolvers built on them.
//!
//! # What already existed, and what this adds
//!
//! The dependency-inversion seam is not new. [`ServiceResolver`] (in [`crate::remote`],
//! where it is the trait [`EvalCtx`](crate::EvalCtx) holds) has always let a host decide
//! how a `SERVICE` clause is answered, and it has always had two implementations proving
//! the inversion is real — an HTTP one and an in-memory one. What it did **not** have was
//! anywhere to put per-service context: its request was four positional arguments
//! (endpoint, query text, stop signal, cell ceiling), so a host could choose *a* resolver
//! but could not tell that resolver anything about the individual service it was about to
//! contact. Headers, credentials, and — the part with teeth — whether this deployment
//! permits that service at all had no home.
//!
//! This module is that home. [`ServiceRequest`] carries the whole request as one value,
//! and a [`ServiceCatalog`] maps a service IRI to the [`ServiceProfile`] that governs it.
//!
//! # Per-service context belongs on the resolver, never in the service IRI
//!
//! A service IRI is a name, not a credential store. Encoding a bearer token, a tenant
//! header, or a "this one is allowed" marker into the IRI would put that context into the
//! *query text*, where it is visible to whoever wrote the query, is serialized into plans
//! and receipts, and travels with a nested `SERVICE` body. So all of it lives on the
//! resolver instead, keyed by endpoint.
//!
//! # Capability gating, and what "in-process federation" buys
//!
//! A capability is a thing the resolver is permitted to *do* while resolving one service:
//! [`ServiceCapability::Query`] (resolve it at all), [`ServiceCapability::Network`]
//! (perform network I/O to do so), and [`ServiceCapability::Credentials`] (attach the
//! profile's credential). Withholding `Network` is what makes `SERVICE`-shaped
//! composition available without `SERVICE`-shaped risk: [`InProcessServiceResolver`]
//! answers from datasets already in memory and holds no transport of any kind, so a query
//! may be written against a federation seam that provably never opens a socket.
//!
//! There is no `ServiceCapabilities::ALL`, deliberately. A blanket grant written once
//! would silently widen the moment a capability is added to the enum, which is precisely
//! the audit a capability set exists to make impossible; a host names what it means.
//!
//! # The `SILENT` contract
//!
//! SPARQL 1.1 §10 says a `SERVICE SILENT` clause whose endpoint cannot be reached "will
//! be considered to have matched with a single, empty, solution" — the join identity, so
//! the surrounding query proceeds unchanged. This crate keeps that promise exactly, and
//! confines it to what it is a promise *about*. Three outcomes, three answers:
//!
//! | Outcome | Non-silent `SERVICE` | `SERVICE SILENT` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | The endpoint is unreachable, or its response undecodable ([`RemoteError::Transport`], [`RemoteError::Decode`], [`RemoteError::Disabled`]) | [`EvalError::Remote`](crate::EvalError) | join identity |
//! | A capability was denied ([`RemoteError::Denied`]) | [`EvalError::ServiceDenied`](crate::EvalError) | [`EvalError::ServiceDenied`](crate::EvalError) |
//! | This engine's own governor tripped ([`RemoteError::Governed`], [`RemoteError::GovernedAfterCompletion`]) | truncation | truncation |
//!
//! The first and last rows are the pre-existing rule, unchanged: `SILENT` is a statement
//! about an endpoint the caller does not control, never about the caller's own budget, so
//! a governor trip reached through a `SERVICE` clause propagates as a truncation whether
//! or not `SILENT` is written (see [`crate::remote`]).
//!
//! **The middle row is decided by that same principle, and it is not configurable.** A
//! capability denial is a decision taken on *this* side of the seam — by the host running
//! this engine, deterministically, before any endpoint was consulted. It is therefore
//! exactly like a governor trip and nothing like an unreachable endpoint, and `SILENT`
//! does not get to swallow it. Swallowing one would put the join identity into a
//! surrounding join, making it a no-op, and hand back an answer that looks complete and
//! is wrong — permanently and identically on every run, rather than transiently, so
//! nothing would ever produce a symptom.
//!
//! There is deliberately no knob that softens this. A host that genuinely wants a blocked
//! service to behave like an unreachable one can already say so with total precision, by
//! returning [`RemoteError::Transport`] from its own resolver: that is an honest claim
//! that the endpoint did not answer, and `SILENT` swallows it under the first row above.
//! The expressive power is in the error type, so a visibility flag would have added no
//! reach — only a second way to spell an existing one, and with it the possibility of two
//! callers running the same query over the same data through the same resolver and
//! getting different answers.
//!
//! The denial row holds at **every depth**. An [`InProcessServiceResolver`] evaluates a
//! forwarded body itself, so a denial raised by a `SERVICE` nested inside one travels back
//! out through that inner evaluation's error channel; it is carried as the structured
//! [`EvalError::ServiceDenied`](crate::EvalError) and reclassified as
//! [`RemoteError::Denied`] on the way out, never flattened into a message. Flattening it
//! would make a nested denial silenceable while the identical denial one level up is not.
