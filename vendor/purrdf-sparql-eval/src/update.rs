//! SPARQL 1.1 **UPDATE** evaluation over a [`MutableDataset`].
//!
//! `eval_update` applies a parsed [`Update`] to a copy-on-write
//! [`MutableDataset`] in request order — each operation observes the effects of the
//! earlier ones through the shared `m`. The engine seam ([`engine`](crate::engine))
//! drives this; the read query path is unchanged.
//!
//! # Doctrine / boundary decisions
//!
//! - **Implicit graph existence.** This is a quad store: a named graph *exists* iff
//!   it holds at least one quad. There is no empty-graph registry, so `CREATE GRAPH`
//!   is a no-op success and `CLEAR` ≡ `DROP` (both just remove every quad of the
//!   target — the only observable state a graph has). `CLEAR`/`DROP`/`CREATE` SILENT
//!   never errors here (there is no missing-graph condition to fail on).
//! - **Snapshot per WHERE op + value-space round-trip.** A `DELETE/INSERT … WHERE`
//!   evaluates its `WHERE` against a *frozen snapshot* of the current effective set
//!   (`m.snapshot_view()`), retaining the immutable base and freezing only its delta. Each
//!   solution term is resolved to a dataset-independent [`TermValue`] (the template
//!   helpers do this), so the resulting quads stay valid after the snapshot is
//!   dropped and are applied back to `m` by value. DELETE is applied before INSERT
//!   (SPARQL §3.1.3), per solution row.
//! - **`WITH` / `USING` active dataset.** `WITH <g>` scopes the `WHERE` default graph
//!   to `g` (and is the default target for template quads). `USING` / `USING NAMED`
//!   build a custom `WHERE` active dataset (§3.1.3): when present they replace `WITH`'s
//!   effect on the `WHERE` (but `WITH` still targets the templates). A `USING` IRI that
//!   names no graph contributes nothing (never an error).
//! - **Blank nodes.** `INSERT DATA` blanks are minted fresh, ONE shared blank-map
//!   for the whole op (they co-refer within the op). `DELETE DATA` is blank-free (a
//!   parser invariant). Template (`DELETE`/`INSERT … WHERE`) blanks are minted fresh
//!   per solution row, exactly like `CONSTRUCT`. All of this mints from ONE
//!   monotonic counter threaded across the whole request (`eval_update`'s
//!   `bnode_counter`), never reset between operations, so a `_:b` label in one
//!   operation is a distinct blank from the same label in another operation
//!   (SPARQL 1.1 Update §4.1.1 / §19.6).
//! - **`LOAD` host seam.** The core is network-free. `LOAD <iri>` needs a host
//!   [`GraphResolver`] to fetch + parse the source into a frozen dataset; with no
//!   resolver, `LOAD` hard-fails unless `SILENT`.
//!
//! # Governors: what an UPDATE is charged for, and why a trip applies nothing
//!
//! An UPDATE runs under the same [`GovernorState`] a governed query runs under, threaded in
//! through the engine seam's evaluation config, and a trip leaves this module as a typed
//! governor rather than as a stringly diagnostic.
//!
//! Two kinds of work are charged, because an UPDATE does two kinds of work:
//!
//! - The `WHERE` clause of a `DELETE/INSERT` is evaluated through an [`EvalCtx`] carrying
//!   the request's governors, so it charges and stops **exactly** as the same pattern
//!   inside a governed `SELECT` does — the same fuel, the same intermediate-cell peak, the
//!   same scratch bytes, the same admission refusal.
//! - The **mutation itself** is charged per quad, at
//!   [`ChargePoint::UpdateMutatedQuad`]. This is not decoration. `CLEAR ALL`, `MOVE`,
//!   `COPY`, `ADD`, `LOAD` and the two `DATA` forms do work proportional to the *store*,
//!   and none of it enters the evaluator — so a ceiling that only bound the `WHERE` would
//!   be one an entire half of the UPDATE surface could never reach, on exactly the
//!   operations whose cost is unbounded by the request text.
//!
//! The stop signal is polled before each operation and immediately before the `LOAD` host
//! seam issues I/O.
//!
//! ## A trip applies nothing
//!
//! `m` **is** mutated incrementally, both within an operation and across the operations of
//! a request: operation N+1 must observe operation N's effects (SPARQL 1.1 Update §3.1), so
//! there is no version of this loop in which earlier operations are held back, and a bulk
//! operation that trips part-way through has already written part of itself. None of that
//! is a rollback problem, because none of it is visible.
//!
//! [`MutableDataset`] is a copy-on-write **branch** off the caller's frozen base, and
//! `crate::engine` publishes it back with a single `m.freeze()` assignment that happens on
//! the success path and nowhere else. Every non-success exit — a diagnostic or a governor
//! trip — simply drops `m`, and dropping a branch is the rollback: the caller's
//! `Arc<RdfDataset>` was never written, so it is the same handle it was before, not merely
//! an equal one. Whatever a half-run operation had reached is dropped with it.
//!
//! Nothing here therefore needs a snapshot/restore of its own, and adding one would be a
//! second, weaker copy of a guarantee the branch already gives structurally. It is also why
//! charging *before* applying a batch is a courtesy rather than a correctness requirement:
//! it wastes less work on a request that is going to be discarded, and discards it either
//! way.
