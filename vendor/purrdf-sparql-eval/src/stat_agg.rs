//! A first-party, CLOSED set of statistical aggregates, delivered through the
//! [`crate::agg_fn`] custom-aggregate seam under a **caller-configured**
//! namespace — never a purrdf-owned vocabulary (see the crate's "mints no
//! vocabulary IRIs" contract). [`AggregateRegistry::register_statistical_aggregates`]
//! is the single entry point: a Rust host that already constructs an
//! [`AggregateRegistry`] (for [`crate::engine::QueryOptions::aggregates`]) calls it
//! once with a namespace IRI, and every member below becomes reachable from the
//! query text as `AGG(<{NAMESPACE}LOCAL-NAME>, args…)` — a Python/WASM/C/CLI
//! binding that already exposes registry configuration gets the whole set for
//! free, through the string surface, with zero additional Rust callbacks.
//!
//! # The shipped set
//!
//! `MEDIAN`, `PERCENTILE`, `STDDEV`, `STDDEV_POP`, `VARIANCE`, `VAR_POP`, `MODE`,
//! `FIRST`, `LAST`, `TOPK` — ten members, closed (no caller extension point; a
//! local name outside this set under the configured namespace is registered
//! nowhere, so `AGG(<{NS}NOT_A_MEMBER>, ?x)` is refused at prepare time exactly as
//! any other unregistered custom-aggregate IRI is).
//!
//! # Numeric discipline
//!
//! Every numeric member works over [`purrdf_xsd::XsdValue`]'s promotion tower
//! (`integer ⊂ decimal ⊂ float ⊂ double`), through the SAME `numeric_add`/
//! `numeric_sub`/`numeric_mul`/`numeric_div`/`numeric_floor` primitives
//! `crate::modifier`'s built-in `SUM`/`AVG` fold uses — a mixed integer/decimal
//! group promotes to decimal exactly the way `AVG(1, 0.5)` already does, and
//! division rounds at the same 18-fractional-digit ceiling `AVG` already accepts.
//! A non-numeric input to a numeric member **poisons** the fold to unbound —
//! `SUM`'s own discipline (see `crate::modifier`'s "Aggregate error handling"
//! docs) — rather than raising a hard error, so one malformed row does not abort
//! the whole query over an otherwise-honest aggregate.
//!
//! `STDDEV`/`STDDEV_POP` take a square root, which is irrational for almost
//! every input and therefore cannot stay in the exact decimal tower the way
//! `VARIANCE`/`VAR_POP` do: the variance itself is computed exactly (promoted
//! per the tower above), and ONLY the final `sqrt` step drops to `xsd:double`
//! (Rust's `f64::sqrt`), mirroring how this crate already treats `xsd:double`
//! as its one inexact numeric tier. `VARIANCE`/`VAR_POP` never leave the exact
//! tower.
//!
//! `STDDEV`/`VARIANCE` are the **sample** statistics (`n - 1` denominator,
//! undefined — unbound — for a group of fewer than 2 values);
//! `STDDEV_POP`/`VAR_POP` are the **population** statistics (`n` denominator,
//! defined, `0`, for a single-value group) — the same naming convention SQL's
//! `STDDEV`/`STDDEV_POP` pair uses.
//!
//! `MEDIAN` is defined as `PERCENTILE` at `p = 0.5` under **linear
//! interpolation between the two closest ranks** (`rank = p × (n − 1)`,
//! interpolating between `⌊rank⌋` and `⌈rank⌉`): for an even-sized group this
//! reduces EXACTLY to the arithmetic mean of the two middle values (the
//! standard reading), computed in the promoted numeric type of those two
//! values — a decimal `0.5` literal keeps the whole computation exact. `p = 0`
//! and `p = 1` reduce to the group's minimum and maximum.
//!
//! # The `xsd:duration` extension
//!
//! `MEDIAN`, `PERCENTILE`, `MODE`, `FIRST`, `LAST`, `TOPK` also accept the
//! `xsd:duration` group (`xsd:duration`/`xsd:yearMonthDuration`/
//! `xsd:dayTimeDuration` — one value space per XSD 1.1 Part 2 §3.3.6, all
//! represented by [`purrdf_xsd::XsdValue::Duration`]) — this crate's
//! SEP-0002 temporal-arithmetic surface ([`purrdf_xsd::value_add`]/
//! [`purrdf_xsd::value_sub`]/[`purrdf_xsd::value_mul`]/
//! [`purrdf_xsd::value_cmp`]) extends the aggregate algebra to durations the
//! same way `crate::modifier`'s `SUM`/`AVG` already do (see that module's
//! "`SUM`/`AVG` over `xsd:duration`" doc section) — a PurRDF extension
//! beyond F&O, which defines none of these over `xsd:duration`.
//!
//! * `MODE`/`FIRST`/`LAST`/`TOPK` needed NO code change at all: they already
//!   fold over a [`TermValue`] of ANY kind (see each member's own doc
//!   section above), gated by nothing numeric-specific — none of their
//!   `step` implementations ever call `is_numeric_xsd`. `MODE`'s tie-break
//!   and `TOPK`'s total order are both `crate::modifier`'s
//!   `project`/`total_order` pair, which already orders duration literals
//!   correctly (through its `parse_by_iri` + `value_cmp` path) — see the
//!   ordering-policy paragraph below for the one difference between that
//!   order and the one `MEDIAN`/`PERCENTILE` use.
//! * `MEDIAN`/`PERCENTILE` (order statistics needing interpolation) widen
//!   their gate from `is_numeric_xsd` alone to "numeric OR duration, never
//!   both in the same group" (see `is_numeric_or_duration_xsd`/
//!   `same_value_family`) — a mixed numeric+duration group POISONS, the
//!   same discipline `crate::modifier`'s duration `SUM`/`AVG` extension
//!   already uses for the identical mixed case. The interpolation step
//!   (`percentile_of`'s `diff`/`scaled`/final sum) now goes through
//!   [`purrdf_xsd::value_sub`]/[`purrdf_xsd::value_mul`]/
//!   [`purrdf_xsd::value_add`] rather than the numeric-tower-only
//!   `numeric_sub`/`numeric_mul`/`numeric_add` — a behavior-preserving
//!   substitution for numeric groups (`value_*` dispatches straight to
//!   `numeric_*` for numeric operands) that ALSO accepts `DUR − DUR`/
//!   `DUR × exact-decimal-fraction`/`DUR + DUR`. `p` itself (`MEDIAN`'s
//!   fixed `0.5`, `PERCENTILE`'s named `P`) and the `rank`/`floor`/
//!   `fraction` derived from it stay on the numeric tower unconditionally
//!   — `p` is a proportion of a COUNT, never a duration, regardless of what
//!   the series holds. A mixed-SUBTYPE duration group
//!   (`yearMonthDuration` values beside `dayTimeDuration` ones) is NOT
//!   mixed-FAMILY, so it does not poison; its interpolated result's
//!   datatype follows the SAME "both dt → dt, both ym → ym, else general"
//!   join [`purrdf_xsd::temporal::add_durations`]/`subtract_durations`/
//!   `multiply_duration` already apply internally — reused as-is through
//!   the public `value_*` surface above, never re-derived here.
//!
//! ## Ordering policy for incomparable duration pairs
//!
//! `P1M` (`yearMonthDuration`) and `P30D` (`dayTimeDuration`) are
//! VALUE-INCOMMENSURABLE — [`purrdf_xsd::value_cmp`] returns `None` for that
//! pair (see its own docs), exactly as it does for a `NaN` numeric
//! comparison. `MEDIAN`/`PERCENTILE`'s sort (inside `finish`, before
//! ranking) already had a policy for THIS exact shape of question before
//! durations existed: `numeric_cmp(a, b).unwrap_or(Ordering::Equal)` — an
//! incomparable pair sorts as EQUAL (stably retaining relative input
//! order), not through a secondary deterministic tie-break key. Widening the
//! comparator's SOURCE from `numeric_cmp` to [`purrdf_xsd::value_cmp`]
//! (needed so duration pairs compare at all) keeps that SAME
//! `.unwrap_or(Ordering::Equal)` policy unchanged — a deliberate
//! CONSISTENCY choice, not the only possible one: `MIN`/`MAX`/`MODE`/`TOPK`
//! (`crate::modifier::fold_extreme`/`total_order`) instead fall back to
//! a genuine total order (further tie-broken by `(datatype, language,
//! lexical form)`), because THEIR existing policy, before durations, was
//! already that total order, not "treat as equal" — each aggregate mirrors
//! ITS OWN prior policy rather than adopting the other's, per this crate's
//! "consistency with the existing surface" rule.
//!
//! # Why `STDDEV`/`STDDEV_POP`/`VARIANCE`/`VAR_POP` stay numeric-only
//!
//! The running-moments fold needs `x²` (`moments_step`'s `numeric_mul(x,
//! x)`) — `xsd:duration × xsd:duration` is NOT in the SEP-0002 value space
//! ([`purrdf_xsd::value_mul`]'s docs: a duration only multiplies by an EXACT
//! numeric factor, never by another duration; "seconds²" or "months²" has no
//! XSD datatype to hold it). There is no well-defined "duration variance" to
//! fall back to without inventing a value space this crate does not own, so
//! this family is deliberately NOT extended — a duration input to
//! `STDDEV`/`VARIANCE` poisons the fold exactly as any other non-numeric
//! value does (the unchanged `is_numeric_xsd` gate in
//! `MomentsAccumulator::step`).
//!
//! # `PERCENTILE`'s named scalarval
//!
//! `AGG(<{NS}PERCENTILE>, ?x; P=0.95)` — `P` is a NAMED SCALARVAL (see
//! [`purrdf_sparql_algebra::AggregateExpression::scalarvals`]'s docs and
//! [`crate::agg_fn::CustomAggregate::scalarvals`]), not a positional argument:
//! ONE value for the whole aggregation, resolved once at accumulator `init`
//! time, never re-evaluated per row. This is a deliberate correction from an
//! earlier shape that took `p` as a second positional argument
//! (`AGG(<{NS}PERCENTILE>, ?x, ?p)`) — semantically wrong, since a positional
//! argument is evaluated PER ROW, and `p` is a parameter of the aggregation
//! itself, not a per-row quantity. `crate::property_fn_plan::plan_aggregate`
//! refuses a call missing `P`, naming an unrecognized scalarval, or supplying
//! a non-numeric `P` at PREPARE time, before any evaluation work is spent. `P`
//! outside `[0, 1]` still poisons the fold to unbound at EVALUATION time
//! (never a hard error — the SAME "poison, don't abort" discipline every
//! other numeric member uses), because that check depends on nothing prepare
//! time can see (a literal `P=1.5` is a well-typed decimal; only its VALUE is
//! out of domain).
//!
//! # `MODE`
//!
//! Works over **any** term kind (it counts term occurrences by RDF term
//! identity — [`purrdf_core::TermValue`]'s own `Eq`, not "value equality":
//! `"5"^^xsd:integer` and `"05"^^xsd:integer` are numerically equal but are
//! counted as two DIFFERENT terms, exactly as `DISTINCT`'s own dedup treats
//! them). A tie among several terms with the same maximum count is broken by
//! the smallest term under the SAME total order `MIN`/`ORDER BY` use
//! (`crate::modifier::total_order`); a further tie (distinct terms
//! that compare value-equal under that order, e.g. `"5"`/`"05"`) falls back to
//! [`purrdf_core::TermValue`]'s own canonical structural order, so the choice
//! is fully deterministic regardless of scan order.
//!
//! # `FIRST`/`LAST`
//!
//! Work over any term kind, in **input row order** (the same row order
//! `GROUP_CONCAT`/`SAMPLE` fold over — see `crate::modifier`'s module docs):
//! `FIRST` is the earliest row's value, `LAST` the latest.
//!
//! # `TOPK`'s named scalarval and its "one term" contract
//!
//! `AGG(<{NS}TOPK>, ?x; K=3)` — `K`, like `PERCENTILE`'s `P`, is a NAMED
//! SCALARVAL, not a positional argument: a positive `xsd:integer`, ONE value
//! for the whole aggregation, resolved once at `init` time (the same
//! correction from an earlier two-positional-argument shape `PERCENTILE`'s
//! docs describe — `K` is a parameter of the aggregation, not a per-row
//! quantity). A missing, non-integer, or non-positive `K` poisons the fold to
//! unbound (never a hard error, the same "poison, don't abort" discipline
//! every other numeric member uses) — `crate::property_fn_plan::plan_aggregate`
//! catches "missing" and "not an `xsd:integer` literal" at prepare time; only
//! "present, well-typed, but `≤ 0`" survives to evaluation, exactly as `P`
//! outside `[0, 1]` does for `PERCENTILE`. Every SPARQL aggregate's contract
//! is to yield exactly ONE RDF term (this crate has no CDT-list container
//! type to hand back "the k values" as a list), so `TOPK` answers the way
//! `GROUP_CONCAT` already answers an inherently multi-valued question: the
//! top `k` values, in DESCENDING order under the SAME total value order
//! `MIN`/`MAX`/`MODE` use, with their **lexical forms** joined by a single
//! fixed space separator (mirroring `crate::modifier`'s `GROUP_CONCAT`, whose
//! default separator is likewise `" "` per SPARQL §18.6.1.7). A configurable
//! separator would need a second named scalarval; `TOPK(value; K=k)` keeps
//! the scalarval contract as simple as `PERCENTILE`'s, so the separator is
//! fixed by design, not by oversight. A term with no lexical form (a blank
//! node or a triple term — the same case `GROUP_CONCAT` itself poisons on)
//! poisons `TOPK` too. `TOPK` retains DUPLICATES — it counts rows, not
//! distinct values, the same multiset reading `insert_bounded` folds under —
//! so fewer than `k` rows in the group (whether or not any repeat) → every
//! value the group has, in row-multiplicity. Empty group → unbound, like
//! every other member here.
//!
//! # Real merges via `AggregateAccumulator::into_any` (all ten are `Volatility::Stable`)
//!
//! [`crate::agg_fn::AggregateAccumulator::combine`] receives `other` as a fully
//! TYPE-ERASED `Box<dyn AggregateAccumulator>`. Naively, the only observable
//! surface through it is `other.finish()` (the pattern this crate's own
//! fixtures use for `SUM`/list-collection — see `crate::agg_fn`'s
//! `SumAccumulator` test and `crate::modifier`'s `ListCollector` test), which
//! is sound EXACTLY when a fold's `finish()` output is *itself* sufficient
//! mergeable state — true for `SUM` (a running total IS the raw state) and
//! `GROUP_CONCAT`/list-collection (a joined string IS the raw state, losslessly
//! re-splittable). It is NOT true for a statistic whose finished, single-term
//! answer throws away the information a correct merge needs: two partial
//! standard deviations cannot be combined into the whole group's standard
//! deviation without each side's count and sum-of-squares too; two partial
//! modes cannot be combined without each side's raw value multiset, which a
//! single winning term does not carry; two partial medians/percentiles/top-`k`
//! sets cannot be combined from their single finished answer at all.
//!
//! [`crate::agg_fn::AggregateAccumulator::into_any`] is the trait's escape
//! hatch for exactly this: it recovers `other`'s original concrete type — same
//! type BY CONSTRUCTION, since every partial accumulator a `combine` chain
//! ever merges was created by the SAME [`crate::agg_fn::CustomAggregate::init`]
//! factory — so `combine` can merge the SAME structural state `step` builds,
//! through `crate::agg_fn::downcast_combine_partial`, rather than a lossy
//! re-derivation from `finish()`. Each member below uses it:
//!
//! * `MEDIAN`/`PERCENTILE` merge their (unsorted-until-`finish`) value lists by
//!   concatenation — merge order does not matter, since `finish` sorts before
//!   computing a rank either way; `PERCENTILE` additionally poisons the merge
//!   if the two sides disagree on `p`, exactly as `step` poisons on a
//!   within-accumulator mismatch.
//! * `MODE` merges its raw value multiset the same way (concatenation):
//!   `finish`'s sort + run-length scan recovers each value's count from
//!   whatever multiset it is handed, so concatenating two partials' lists IS
//!   "sum the counts per value" — no explicit count map is needed to get that
//!   effect.
//! * `STDDEV`/`STDDEV_POP`/`VARIANCE`/`VAR_POP` merge their `(n, Σx, Σx²)`
//!   moments componentwise (`n + n'`, `Σx + Σx'`, `Σx² + Σx'²`) — exact, no
//!   precision loss, for the same reason the running fold itself is exact (see
//!   this family's own doc comment below).
//! * `TOPK` merges by inserting one side's values into the other's bounded
//!   top-`k` set and truncating (`insert_bounded`, the same primitive `step`
//!   itself uses) — a bounded-structure merge, never `O(group size)`.
//!
//! Every one of these merges is a genuinely deterministic fold with no
//! dependency on WHICH worker produced which partial or in what order two
//! partials of equal size are combined (see each member's [`AlgebraicClass`]
//! for the precise law) — these eight were never actually nondeterministic,
//! only architecturally unable to merge through the finish-only path. All ten
//! members (these eight plus `FIRST`/`LAST`) therefore declare
//! `Volatility::Stable`, the honest classification for a fully deterministic
//! fold, and are eligible for `crate::modifier::eval_custom_aggregate`'s
//! within-group chunked fold exactly like any other `Stable` custom aggregate.
//!
//! `FIRST`/`LAST` are the two members whose `finish()` output (the earliest
//! or latest value seen SO FAR) genuinely is sufficient state on its own — an
//! earlier chunk's first value stays the group's first value no matter what a
//! later chunk saw, and symmetrically for `LAST` — so both merge through
//! `finish()`, needing no downcast.
//!
//! # `state_bound` honesty
//!
//! [`crate::agg_fn::CustomAggregate::state_bound`] is a FIXED, per-aggregate
//! declaration — it takes no group-size parameter, so it cannot literally
//! bound a fold whose real memory is proportional to its group's cardinality
//! (`MEDIAN`/`PERCENTILE`/`MODE`, which retain the whole group) or to a
//! per-call argument the declaration is read before any row is seen
//! (`TOPK`'s `k`). The running-moments accumulators (`STDDEV`/`STDDEV_POP`/
//! `VARIANCE`/`VAR_POP` — see that section below for why they are `(n, Σx,
//! Σx²)`, not Welford's `(n, mean, M2)`) are the one family that IS genuinely
//! `O(1)`: three
//! stack-only [`purrdf_xsd::XsdValue`] numeric fields (`Integer`/`Decimal`/
//! `Float`/`Double` never heap-allocate) plus a row count, regardless of
//! group size. The rest declare a nominal, documented estimate rather than a
//! true worst case — the SAME convention this crate's own
//! `ListCollectorAggregate` test fixture already uses (a flat `256` despite
//! folding thousands of rows) — because true adversarial growth is bounded
//! ANYWAY by [`crate::governor::ChargePoint::AggregateAccumulation`]'s
//! per-row `Fuel` charge, a SEPARATE governed dimension from `ScratchBytes`
//! that already prices the number of rows any single group may fold.
//!
//! # `DISTINCT`
//!
//! Handled entirely by the evaluator before an accumulator's `step` ever
//! runs (see `crate::modifier::eval_custom_aggregate`'s phase-1 tuple dedup)
//! — nothing in this module special-cases it.

// deliberate refinement of the plan's "Welford-style" starting point: Welford
// exists to solve TWO problems, and this representation gets BOTH without
// Welford's cost. First, avoiding catastrophic cancellation under
// FLOATING-POINT re-association — irrelevant to this crate's EXACT
// decimal/integer tower, where `Σx²` and `(Σx)²` are exact integers/decimals
// with no cancellation error to avoid. Second, being incrementally mergeable
// across parallel partial folds — needed, since this family IS
// `Volatility::Stable` and folds across `crate::parallel::par_chunk_reduce_init`
// chunks (see the module docs' "Real merges" section) — but `(n, Σx, Σx²)`
// merges through PLAIN componentwise addition (`MomentsAccumulator::combine`),
// simpler and cheaper than Welford's own pairwise-merge formula, and exactly
// as exact as the sequential fold. What Welford's per-row division WOULD cost
// here, with no benefit over the sum/sum-of-squares form's simpler merge, is
// precision: `mean = mean + delta/n` rounds once PER ROW at this crate's
// 18-fractional-digit decimal-division ceiling
// (`purrdf_xsd::numeric::MAX_DECIMAL_SCALE`), so an all-integer group's
// population variance can drift off its exact integer answer by a few units
// in the 18th digit. The sum/sum-of-squares form divides exactly ONCE (twice,
// for the final `Σx²ᵢ − (Σx)²/n` and once more for `/ denom`), so an
// all-integer or all-decimal group's variance stays EXACTLY the textbook
// answer regardless of how many chunks it was folded across — see this
// module's `var_pop_matches_the_known_dataset` test, which pins the exact
// `"4"` this form produces, and
// `stat_agg_moments_chunked_fold_forced_parallel_and_sequential_agree` in
// `crate::modifier`'s tests, which pins that a chunked fold reproduces it
// exactly.
