//! The SEP-0009 **`UNFOLD` graph pattern**: one solution per element of a
//! composite value.
//!
//! ```text
//! [174] Unfold ::= 'UNFOLD' '(' Expression 'AS' Var ( ',' Var )? ')'
//! ```
//!
//! [`crate::cdt_agg`]'s dual: `FOLD` collapses a group's rows into one composite,
//! `UNFOLD` expands one composite back into rows. Each input solution contributes
//! its own contiguous block of output solutions, in the composite's own order,
//! and the blocks follow their input rows' order — which is what makes this
//! operator's edge to its child monotone (see
//! `crate::governor::soundness::visit_pattern_parts`).
//!
//! # What the two variables bind
//!
//! Decided by the value's DATATYPE, not by the syntax — the same expression
//! reaching a `cdt:List` in one row and a `cdt:Map` in the next binds different
//! things in each, which is why [`purrdf_sparql_algebra::GraphPattern::Unfold`]'s
//! fields are named for their position:
//!
//! | value | `element` | `companion` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `cdt:List` | the element, in list order, duplicates preserved (`unfold-list-1var-01/02`) | the **1-based** `xsd:integer` index (`unfold-list-2vars-01`) |
//! | `cdt:Map` | the entry's key (`unfold-map-1var-01`) | the entry's value (`unfold-map-2vars-01`) |
//!
//! A `null` in either position binds NOTHING and does **not** suppress the row: a
//! null list element yields a row whose `element` is unbound while its index is
//! still bound (`unfold-list-1var-09/10`, `unfold-list-2vars-09`), and a null map
//! value yields a row binding the key alone (`unfold-map-2vars-08`). That is the
//! same `null`-is-not-a-term rule `cdt:get` follows when it answers an expression
//! error for a null position — read as a graph pattern rather than an expression,
//! "no term" is an unbound column, not a dropped row.
//!
//! A blank node inside the composite is a real blank node scoped to the literal
//! and shared within it, so two occurrences of one label bind the SAME node
//! (`unfold-list-1var-08`) and two labels bind two (`-07`). Nothing here does that
//! on purpose: it falls out of [`crate::cdt_fn::from_cdt_term`]'s `(label, scope)`
//! round trip, which is also why an unfolded element is `sameTerm` with what
//! `cdt:get` returns for the same position (all ten `unfold-get-*` cases).
//!
//! # A row whose expression denotes no composite PASSES THROUGH
//!
//! Unbound, raised, not `cdt:`-typed, or a `cdt:`-typed literal whose lexical form
//! does not parse: all four are "this row has nothing to expand", and all four
//! emit the INPUT ROW UNCHANGED, with both targets unbound.
//!
//! This is not a first-party choice. SEP-0009 §12.3 fixes it in the definitions
//! of both algebra operators, in the same words: "If var ∉ dom(μ) and expr(μ) is
//! an error or an RDF term that is neither a well-formed cdt:List literal nor a
//! well-formed cdt:Map literal, then Unfold1(μ, var, expr) = { μ }", with
//! cardinality 1 at μ. `Unfold2` repeats it for its pair.
//!
//! The vendored corpus does NOT pin this — all 42 `unfold` cases use a
//! well-formed composite — so reading the corpus alone leads to the opposite,
//! plausible-sounding answer (a graph pattern that matches nothing yields no
//! rows). The spec text is the authority here, and it says otherwise.
//!
//! An EMPTY composite is a DIFFERENT condition with a different answer: zero
//! rows. `UNFOLD` is one row per element, and zero elements is zero rows — see
//! the Notes under both §12.3 definitions, which state the empty-multiset result
//! for the empty term list and the empty term map explicitly. It is not one row
//! with an unbound target either, since that would claim an element exists whose
//! value is `null`, a different value from an empty list.
//!
//! Keeping the two apart is load-bearing rather than pedantic: under `OPTIONAL`,
//! `MINUS` and `FILTER NOT EXISTS`, a column that is only SOMETIMES a composite
//! gives different answers depending on which reading is used.
//!
//! The one thing that is NOT swallowed is a hard failure while evaluating the
//! expression itself ([`crate::error::EvalError::CompositeBound`] from a
//! constructor whose result crosses a `purrdf-cdt` bound): that propagates and
//! fails the query, exactly as it does in every other expression position.
//!
//! # A pre-bound target is a join, not a shadow
//!
//! The parser refuses `UNFOLD` over a variable already in scope (`BIND`'s §19.6
//! rule, applied to both targets), so query text never reaches the case below.
//! Algebra built directly through the public API can, and the answer is SPARQL's
//! own: the produced binding is JOINED against what the row already holds — the
//! row survives only if the two agree — rather than overwriting it. A `null`
//! position produces no binding at all, so it agrees with whatever was there and
//! leaves it untouched.
//!
//! # A nested composite unfolds again
//!
//! An element that is itself a composite comes back as a `cdt:`-typed literal in
//! canonical form — the same term `cdt:get` returns for that position — because
//! [`crate::cdt_fn::from_cdt_term`] re-renders a nested value rather than
//! flattening it. A second `UNFOLD` over the bound element therefore expands the
//! inner composite with no further ceremony, which is what makes the operator
//! compose with itself.
