//! Path **witnesses** as property functions: a relation that binds not merely the
//! endpoints of a traversal but the traversal itself — every hop, in order, as a
//! first-class RDF 1.2 statement term.
//!
//! # Why a walk, and not a node sequence
//!
//! The core SPARQL grammar's property paths answer a *reachability* question: `?s ex:p+
//! ?o` says that some sequence of `ex:p` edges leads from `?s` to `?o`, and the answer
//! is the endpoint pair. The derivation — *which* edges — is not expressible, so a query
//! that needs to explain, weight, filter or re-join the route has nowhere to look.
//!
//! This module's relations answer the derivation question. The object they enumerate is
//! a **walk**
//!
//! ```text
//! n0 --e1--> n1 --e2--> ... --ek--> nk
//! ```
//!
//! where each `ei` is a traversed **statement**, not merely a predicate. That
//! distinction is load-bearing rather than decorative. A [`PathStep`] is an *ordered
//! alternation* of directed predicates, so two DIFFERENT statements can join the SAME
//! pair of nodes — `ex:a ex:p ex:b` and `ex:b ex:q ex:a` both take you from `ex:a` to
//! `ex:b` under the step `(ex:p, Forward) | (ex:q, Inverse)`. A node-only model reports
//! one walk where there are two, silently erasing a derivation. Recording the statement
//! keeps the two apart, and it does so in a form the rest of the query language already
//! understands: in RDF 1.2 a statement IS a term, so each hop is emitted as a
//! [`TermValue::Triple`] in **asserted orientation** (subject, predicate, object as
//! written in the data, whichever way the step traversed it) and joins straight back
//! into the dataset by an ordinary basic graph pattern. Direction is not lost by that
//! choice — it is recoverable by comparing the statement's subject to the node the hop
//! started from.
//!
//! # The row shape
//!
//! Both relations declare [`PfArity::new(1, 6)`](PfArity::new) — one subject-side
//! argument and six object-side ones — so a call reads
//!
//! ```text
//! ?start <caller-iri> ( ?end ?pathId ?len ?step ?node ?edge )
//! ```
//!
//! and the flattened positions are `[0] = start`, `[1] = end`, `[2] = pathId`,
//! `[3] = len`, `[4] = step`, `[5] = node`, `[6] = edge`.
//!
//! **One row per hop.** A walk of `k` hops emits exactly `k` rows; row `i` (1-based) is
//! `(n0, nk, pathId, k, i, n_i, e_i)`. The whole walk is therefore recoverable inside
//! the query language: group by `?pathId`, order by `?step`, and the node sequence is
//! `?start` followed by `?node`, while `?node` at `?step = ?len` is `?end`. `?step` and
//! `?len` are `xsd:integer`-typed literals rather than simple ones precisely so
//! `ORDER BY ?step` orders numerically; a simple literal would sort `"10"` before `"2"`
//! and silently scramble the reconstruction.
//!
//! ## Reconstructing the whole walk: the `GROUP_CONCAT` recipe
//!
//! One row per hop is not a lossy shape. It carries strictly more than an `rdf:List` of
//! nodes would — it names the traversed STATEMENT of every hop, which a node list cannot
//! express — and the node sequence an `rdf:List` would have held is recoverable in the
//! query language itself, with no unfolding operator and no host code:
//!
//! ```text
//! PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/>
//! SELECT ?start ?end ?len (GROUP_CONCAT(?node; separator="->") AS ?route)
//! WHERE {
//!   ?start <http://example.org/pf#walk> ( ?end ?pathId ?len ?step ?node ?edge )
//! }
//! GROUP BY ?pathId ?start ?end ?len
//! ORDER BY ?len ?start
//! ```
//!
//! `GROUP BY ?pathId` is the whole trick: the identifier is constant across one walk's
//! rows and distinct between walks, so each group IS one walk. `?start`, `?end` and
//! `?len` are constant within a group, so grouping by them alongside is free and lets
//! them be projected. The concatenation order is `?step` order, which is why `?step` is
//! an `xsd:integer` and not a simple literal.
//!
//! The same grouping reconstructs the EDGE sequence — swap `?node` for `?edge` — and the
//! same group is where an aggregate over a walk belongs: `SUM` of a per-hop weight joined
//! in through `?edge`, `MIN` of a per-hop confidence, a `HAVING` that keeps only routes
//! whose every hop is annotated. None of that is reachable from a relation that returned
//! endpoints, and none of it needed a list term.
//!
//! # The snapshot is not the queried dataset
//!
//! **A relation is built from a dataset at construction, and the property-function seam
//! hands a relation no dataset at evaluation time.** [`PropertyFunction::open`] receives
//! bound arguments and a row ceiling — nothing else. So a [`PathGraph`] snapshotted from
//! dataset *A* and registered in a registry that is then used to evaluate a query against
//! dataset *B* will answer, silently and without any diagnostic, about *A*'s edges. The
//! query text names no dataset the relation can check itself against, and the seam has no
//! place to put one.
//!
//! This is a precondition on the HOST, and it is not negotiable. Do not try to fix it by
//! reshaping the seam: a relation that took a dataset would be a relation whose answers
//! depended on a value the planner cannot see when it prices the call, and every
//! host-injected relation — a text index, a vector store, a remote service — would then
//! have to explain what it does with a dataset it does not read.
//!
//! The pattern that avoids it is to build the relation where the dataset is chosen, per
//! dataset, and never to hoist a registry above the thing it describes:
//!
//! ```text
//! // WRONG: one registry, built once, evaluated against whatever arrives.
//! let registry = build_walk_registry(&startup_dataset);
//! for dataset in incoming { engine.query_with_options_view(dataset, .., &registry) }
//!
//! // RIGHT: the snapshot's lifetime is the dataset's.
//! for dataset in incoming {
//!     let registry = build_walk_registry(dataset);
//!     engine.query_with_options_view(dataset, .., &registry)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A host that caches snapshots deliberately — because rebuilding one per query is real
//! work — asserts the pairing instead of assuming it, and it asserts it by CALLING
//! something. [`PathGraph::assert_matches`] is that call: hand it the dataset about to be
//! queried and the graph selector to read it under, and it returns `Ok(())` or a
//! diagnostic naming both sides. A mitigation that exists only as a paragraph telling a
//! host to compare a value is a swallowed error with extra steps, so this one is
//! executable, and the doctest below runs it.
//!
//! **A match is proof, not evidence.** It re-reads the step over the presented dataset and
//! compares [`PathSnapshotFingerprint::content_digest`] — a full, untruncated SHA-256
//! folded from [`TermValue::canonical_bytes`], the injective encoding, over the whole
//! canonical edge set. Two snapshots share that value if and only if they record the same
//! edges. The counts alongside it are informational and decide nothing: they belong partly
//! to the dataset rather than to the subgraph, and
//! [`DatasetView::stats_fingerprint`]'s trait DEFAULT is a constant `0`, so a check resting
//! on it would compare nothing at all against a backend that never overrode it.
//!
//! The scope is the edge set, and that is the right scope rather than a compromise: the
//! edge set is the entire part of a dataset these relations ever read. A dataset that grew
//! a thousand quads under predicates the step does not name still yields the same walks,
//! and the check says so instead of refusing a snapshot that is genuinely still valid.

//!
//! # Walk semantics: the simple-prefix walk
//!
//! Every node on an enumerated walk is distinct, EXCEPT that the FINAL node may repeat
//! an earlier node. Such a walk closes a cycle and **terminates** there: it is emitted,
//! and it is not extended further.
//!
//! Three properties follow, and each one is why the rule is this and not something
//! simpler:
//!
//! * **It is finite on cyclic input.** The proper prefix `n0 … n_{k-1}` is simple, so
//!   `k` is bounded by the snapshot's node count — and independently by
//!   [`PathLimits::max_hops`]. No visited-set-free enumeration is needed, and no cycle
//!   can diverge.
//! * **Its endpoint projection equals `p+`.** When `max_hops` is at least the node
//!   count, the set of `(?start, ?end)` pairs this relation produces is exactly the
//!   reachability relation the core grammar's `p+` computes over the same edges. A
//!   *strictly* simple rule would not have that property: under it a node never reaches
//!   itself, whereas `p+` says a node reaches itself precisely when it lies on a cycle.
//!   Allowing the final node alone to repeat restores exactly those answers and no
//!   others.
//! * **It is not the same as the ALP fixpoint for EXACT repetition.** `p{n,m}` in the
//!   core grammar is `k`-fold composition, which admits walks that revisit INTERIOR
//!   nodes. Over `ex:a ex:p ex:b . ex:b ex:p ex:a .` the query `ex:a ex:p{2,2} ?x` binds
//!   `?x = ex:a` through the walk `a → b → a`, which is simple-prefix and which this
//!   relation therefore also finds. But a longer walk that revisits an interior node —
//!   `a → b → a → b` for `p{3,3}` — is NOT enumerated here, because its prefix
//!   `a → b → a` is not simple. That is the exact boundary: this relation is complete
//!   for reachability and for every simple-prefix derivation of it, and it is
//!   deliberately incomplete for interior-revisiting derivations, which are unbounded in
//!   number on any cyclic graph and so have no finite witness enumeration at all.
//!
//! ## What the reference engine does here, observed
//!
//! Virtuoso's `OPTION(TRANSITIVE ...)` is the closest production analogue of this
//! surface, so it was RUN rather than reasoned about. Against **Virtuoso Open Source
//! Edition, Version 07.20.3243**, over the 3-cycle
//! `ex:a ex:p ex:b . ex:b ex:p ex:c . ex:c ex:p ex:a .`, the query
//! `OPTION ( TRANSITIVE, t_distinct, t_in(?s), t_out(?o), t_min(1), t_step(?s) as ?link,
//! t_step('path_id') as ?path, t_step('step_no') as ?step )` seeded at `ex:a` returned
//! three rows, and `ex:a` never appeared among the outputs: the cycle-closing walk
//! `a → b → c → a` was NOT produced. The SAME query with `t_distinct` removed did not
//! terminate — still running with no output after 120 seconds, and killed.
//!
//! Both observations are why the rule above is written the way it is, and neither is a
//! guess about the other engine.
//!
//! * The omitted cycle-closing walk is not an economy, it is a wrong answer to
//!   `ex:a ex:p+ ?end`: `p+` binds `?end = ex:a` precisely because `ex:a` lies on a cycle.
//!   Admitting the repeat in the FINAL position — and only there — is what keeps this
//!   relation's endpoint projection EQUAL to `p+` rather than a subset of it. On this
//!   input the relation is therefore strictly more complete than the reference, and the
//!   divergence is deliberate; test A16 pins it.
//! * Termination here is a property of the walk rule, not of an option the caller has to
//!   remember to pass. There is no query against this relation that diverges on cyclic
//!   input, because the simple-prefix bound is structural: the proper prefix is simple, so
//!   its length is bounded by the node count regardless of what any caller asks for. That
//!   is the concrete limitation this work refuses to inherit.
//!
//! # Two relations, not one relation with a mode switch
//!
//! [`PathWitnessRelation`] enumerates EVERY simple-prefix walk. That is the complete
//! answer to the derivation question, and its cardinality is exponential in the worst
//! case, because the number of simple paths in a dense graph is.
//!
//! [`ShortestPathWitnessRelation`] yields ONE shortest witness per reachable
//! `(seed, end)` pair, breadth-first with per-node best-depth pruning. Its cardinality
//! is polynomial — at most one walk per node pair — and it is the form most "how is
//! `a` connected to `b`" questions actually want. It is the analogue of Virtuoso's
//! `T_SHORTEST_ONLY` transitivity option.
//!
//! They are two public TYPES over one shared [`Arc<PathGraph>`], not one type carrying a
//! runtime mode flag. A mode flag would make cardinality — the single most important
//! thing the planner reads from a relation, via
//! [`PropertyFunction::rows_per_invocation`] — a property of a value the planner cannot
//! see. As two types, "exponential" and "polynomial" are two different registrations
//! under two different IRIs, and a host that wants only the cheap one simply never
//! registers the other.
//!
//! # The walk identifier
//!
//! `?pathId` is a simple literal holding the lowercase hex of the **full, untruncated**
//! 32-byte SHA-256 of
//!
//! ```text
//! PATH_ID_DOMAIN_V1 || cb(n0) || ( cb(e_i) || cb(n_i) )* || u64_le(hop_count)
//! ```
//!
//! where `cb` is [`TermValue::canonical_bytes`], the injective encoding. The digest is
//! not truncated because the identifier is a GROUPING KEY in query answers — `GROUP BY
//! ?pathId` is how a caller reassembles a walk from its hop rows — so a collision is not
//! a slowdown, it is two walks fused into one wrong answer, and this crate does not trade
//! correctness for bytes.
//!
//! ## What the digest deliberately does NOT cover
//!
//! * **The graph selector.** [`GraphMatch<D::Id>`](GraphMatch) is parameterised by
//!   DATASET-LOCAL ids, so folding it in would make the identifier a function of intern
//!   order — two datasets holding identical data would mint different identifiers purely
//!   because their term tables were built in different orders.
//! * **The step definition.** Two steps that happen to admit the same walk describe the
//!   same derivation, and a caller comparing results across two configured relations
//!   should see that.
//! * **The limits.** The same walk must get the same identifier under a `max_hops` of 4
//!   and of 400; an envelope decides which walks are enumerated, never what they are.
//!
//! ## Stability scope, stated honestly
//!
//! An identifier is identical across runs, across processes, across row ceilings, across
//! read-subsets of the same data, and across independently built datasets holding the
//! same data — **except** for a walk whose nodes or statements contain a blank node.
//! [`TermValue::Blank`] carries a label and a scope, both of which depend on how the data
//! was parsed, so two datasets that are isomorphic but were loaded differently will mint
//! different identifiers for the same blank-node-bearing walk. That is not a defect of
//! the digest: it is blank-node identity, and no content-derived key can be stabler than
//! the terms it is derived from.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Every ordered surface here is a pure function of the snapshot's contents:
//!
//! * Node indices are assigned in [`TermValue`] `Ord` order, so sorting by dense index
//!   IS sorting by value, and no map iteration order (hash-seeded or otherwise) can
//!   reach an emitted row.
//! * Each node's neighbour list is frozen in `(to, statement)` order at snapshot time.
//! * Seeds are visited in ascending node index — that is, ascending `TermValue` order.
//!
//! See each relation's own emission-order contract for the resulting row order.

/// plan". In this engine a relation's [`PropertyFunction::rows_per_invocation`] is
/// multiplied by the driving row count into
/// [`PlanEstimate::rows`](crate::governor::ledger::PlanEstimate) and its `peak_rows`
/// twin; `PlanEstimate::peak_cells` multiplies that by the call's arity; and admission
/// control refuses the whole query — unevaluated, as `TrippedGovernor::Refused` on
/// `ResourceDimension::IntermediateCells` — the moment that product exceeds the caller's
/// ceiling. An over-declared bound therefore REFUSES legitimate input. It does not
/// degrade a plan; it withholds an answer.
///
/// That is why nothing here is a function of [`PathLimits::max_paths_per_seed`] alone.
/// That guard is a caller-chosen statement about how much work it will buy, not a
/// property of the graph, and letting it dominate made a four-node chain declare tens of
/// thousands of rows. It appears below only as a CEILING — the traversal errors out on
/// the candidate that exceeds it, so it can never be exceeded — taken as a `min` against
/// what the graph could actually produce.
///
/// # The structural bound
///
/// A walk of `k` hops is bounded two independent ways, and the tighter one wins:
///
/// * **Branching.** At most [`GraphShape::max_out_degree`] edges leave any node, so a
///   `k`-hop walk is one of at most `d_out^k` edge sequences. With `?end` bound, the last
///   hop must instead be one of the at most [`GraphShape::max_in_degree`] edges arriving
///   there, giving `d_out^(k-1) × d_in`.
/// * **Edge distinctness.** A simple-prefix walk's first `k` nodes are distinct, so its
///   `k` hops leave `k` distinct nodes and are therefore `k` distinct edges: at most
///   `edge_count × (edge_count - 1) × … × (edge_count - k + 1)` of them. This term is
///   what makes a walk longer than the edge count impossible rather than merely unlikely,
///   and it is why a three-edge cycle under `max_hops = 8` declares three walks and not
///   eight.
///
/// Only lengths in `[min_hops, max_hops]` are summed, because a shorter walk is not a
/// candidate and contributes no row. A walk of `k` hops emits `k` rows, or exactly one
/// when `?step` is bound.
///

/// seed, every walk whose proper prefix is simple and whose length lies in the envelope
/// is enumerated, and each is reported hop by hop with a content-derived identifier that
/// ties its rows together.
///
/// # Emission order (the relation's contract)
///
/// 1. Seeds in ascending dense node index, which is ascending [`TermValue`] order. A
///    bound `?start` is a single seed.
/// 2. Within a seed, **depth-first preorder over accepted walks**: a walk is emitted at
///    the moment its final hop is taken, BEFORE any of its own extensions. So
///    `a → b` precedes `a → b → c`, which precedes `a → b → d`.
/// 3. Neighbours are explored in the snapshot's frozen `(to, statement)` order.
/// 4. Within a walk, rows ascend by `?step`, from 1 to `?len`.
///
/// Every one of those four is a pure function of the snapshot's contents and the bound
/// arguments — no map iteration, no wall clock, no thread scheduling — as
/// [`PfCursor`]'s emission-order contract requires.
///
/// # Cardinality
///
/// Exponential in the worst case, because the number of simple paths in a dense graph is.
/// That is not a defect of the implementation; it is the size of the answer. A caller who
/// wants a polynomial answer wants [`ShortestPathWitnessRelation`], which is a different
/// question with a different answer, registered under a different IRI.
///
/// ## What the declared bound is, and where it is exact
///
/// [`PropertyFunction::rows_per_invocation`] here is `row_bound` over the snapshot's
/// shape — see its docs for the derivation, and for why an over-declaration is an
/// over-REFUSAL rather than a merely worse plan. Per mode:
///
/// * **`?start` bound** — the bound is the rows the single MAXIMAL seed could contribute.
///   It is EXACT whenever the pinned seed is that maximal one, which on a uniformly
///   branching graph (a chain seeded at its head, any seed of a cycle) is every seed.
/// * **`?start` free** — `node_count` times the above. The gap to the truth is exactly the
///   seeds that realise less than the maximum, which a bound derived from a MODE cannot
///   see, because a mode names no seed.
/// * **`?end` bound** — narrowed: the final hop must be one of the at most `max_in_degree`
///   edges arriving at the endpoint, so the branching term loses a factor.
/// * **`?step` bound** — every walk contributes at most its single row at that ordinal,
///   so the per-walk factor is one instead of `max_hops`. Exact when every candidate walk
///   is long enough to have that ordinal.
/// * **`?len` bound** — deliberately NOT narrowed. A bound `?len` pins the walk length
///   exactly, but `rows_per_invocation` is handed a binding pattern and never a value, so
///   the length it would narrow to is unknown here. This is the loosest mode, and it is
///   loose for a stated reason rather than an unexamined one.
/// * **`?pathId` bound** — at most one walk survives an injective identifier, so at most
///   `max_hops` rows (or one, under a bound `?step`).
///
/// `the_row_bound_is_pinned_against_what_is_emitted` and
/// `the_row_bound_stays_tight_on_a_dense_graph` are the executable form of that table:
/// they pin the declared number AND the emitted number, side by side, for every mode over
/// four fixtures including a complete digraph.
///
/// # Guards
///
/// [`PathLimits::max_paths_per_seed`] and
/// [`PathLimits::max_expansions_per_invocation`] bound work ACTUALLY PERFORMED, so
/// whether either fires depends on the row ceiling the engine granted: a `LIMIT 1` query

/// Binds ONE shortest witness per reachable `(seed, end)` pair, one row per hop.
///
/// Where [`PathWitnessRelation`] answers "show me every derivation", this answers "show
/// me *a* derivation, the shortest one" — and that is the question most connectivity
/// queries are actually asking. It is the analogue of Virtuoso's `T_SHORTEST_ONLY`
/// transitivity option, and it is the only form of this relation whose cardinality is
/// polynomial rather than exponential: at most one walk per node pair, so at most
/// `node_count²` walks over the whole snapshot.
///
/// # Which shortest witness, when several tie
///
/// The traversal is a breadth-first search with per-node best-depth pruning: a node is
/// recorded the FIRST time it is discovered, and never again. So the chosen witness is
/// deterministic and stateable: it is the one whose immediate predecessor was dequeued
/// earliest, and, among that predecessor's edges, the one earliest in the snapshot's
/// frozen `(to, statement)` order. Ties are therefore broken by the frozen order, which
/// is itself [`TermValue`] order — never by a hash seed or an arrival order.
///
/// Note that "shortest" is a property of the WALK, not of the derivation: two different
/// statements may join the same two nodes, and this relation reports one of them.
///
/// # Emission order (the relation's contract)
///
/// 1. Seeds in ascending dense node index, which is ascending [`TermValue`] order.
/// 2. Within a seed, witnesses in breadth-first DISCOVERY order — non-decreasing by
///    `?len`, and within one length in the order the search reached them.
/// 3. Within a walk, rows ascend by `?step`.
///
/// # Cardinality, and the declared bound
///
/// Polynomial: at most one witness per `(seed, end)` pair, so at most `node_count²` walks
/// over the whole snapshot. That cap is what this relation contributes to `row_bound` on
/// top of the structural one — `node_count` walks per seed, or ONE under a bound `?end` —
/// and it is why this relation prices strictly cheaper than [`PathWitnessRelation`] over
/// the same graph, which is the whole planner-visible difference between the two IRIs. The
/// per-mode exactness notes on [`PathWitnessRelation`] apply here unchanged.
///
/// # The seed can be its own endpoint
///
/// The seed is deliberately NOT pre-marked as discovered at depth zero, so a seed that
/// lies on a cycle is discovered at its own shortest cycle length and reported like any
/// other endpoint. That is what keeps this relation's endpoint projection agreeing with
/// the core grammar's `p+`, under which a node reaches itself exactly when it lies on a
/// cycle. It is not re-expanded when rediscovered: everything reachable through it was
/// already reached from it at depth zero, at a distance no greater.
///
/// # Guards
///
/// As for [`PathWitnessRelation`]: [`PathLimits::max_paths_per_seed`] and
/// [`PathLimits::max_expansions_per_invocation`] bound work ACTUALLY PERFORMED, so
/// whether either fires depends on the row ceiling the engine granted — a `LIMIT 1` query
/// may stop before the guard while the same query without `LIMIT` trips it. A breach is
/// always an [`Err`], never a short [`Ok`].
